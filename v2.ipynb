      "My best friend and her husband of 15 years have been hoping to be parents for a long time. They have had two miscarriges (one last year at this time that was devastating) Mary is 39 and Brian is 38. She does not feel she can go through another pregnancy loss. She has had it on her heart for awhile to adopt, her husband had not gotten there yet. Yesterday at my church, there was information about a young teen looking for a Christian couple to adopt her baby due in December. It was like a bolt from above I knew I had to tell my friend of this situation. I talked to my husband about this (he freaked at first thinking I wanted to adopt a fouth baby) after I calmed him down and explained, he agreed that they needed to know. When I called her, she then talked to her husband and they called back in ten minutes to say they were interested. I have left a message with our pastor and the church office for more information. I am just so scared for them to be hurt again. I know I had to let them know, I just felt it. I am asking for prayers that they can finally become parents and that even if this situation does not work out, that their hearts remain open and that God continues to work in their lives for good. Thank you Becky  \n",
      "Congratulations to you! Enjoy every minute, even those sleep deprived ones! God Bless. Becky  \n",
      "Hi! I have lived in the Denver area my whole life. To me you can't beat it. We have sunshine nearly every day, even when it rains or snows the sun is close behind. We have the beautiful mountains and if you are sports/outdoor minded we have anything you could want. We are also always rated highly as one of themost physically fit ciites/states in the country. Our cost of living has gone up recently, but is still nothing compared to where you will come from. We live in a south metro suburb and 3000 sq. ft. homes are running about $300. You can live in a very nice area for $500. As for diversity, it is much more diverse than when I was growing up. As I said we live in a pretty traditional suburb and my boys who are racially mixed have some classmates and sports team members who are as well. Of course as this is my home, I am partial to it. The only thing I wish we had here is the ocean, then it would be perfect! Good luck! Becky  \n",
      "I can so relate to this situation. My daughter's birthmom is always in crisis. It is very sad but I suspect she will always live her life this way. Much of the contact we have with her is about her and not our daughter. She has another child and an abusive boyfriend and drug issues and financial issues and mental health issues and family problems and....well you get the point. At first I felt compelled to try and help in any way I could, in time (A is almost 3) I came to realize that I can not fix her or her problems, they were created many years before we met. I quit helping for the most part in any financial way, I buy birthday and Christmas presents for them, I pay for professional pictures of the girls, I pass on A's old clothes for the baby, we babysit every month or so overnight so that she can have a break (and so that our daughter and her sister can form a relationship). I also listen to her and give advice at times, although I am pretty brutally honest about what I think are the problems and don't let her BS me anymore. We have caller ID and if I don't feel up to talking to her I let the machine pick it up let her leave a message and call back when I want to. I don't pick up numbers that I do not recogninze anymore. If she gives obvious hints about wanting or needing something I usually just say something like \"I can understand why you would want that, or I hope that works out for you.\" If she point blank asks me for something I will help her find a resource to obtain that item if possible, or I will point out that we have a family to care for so I don't have a lot of extra money for anything else. The biggest problem I see with our relationship at this time is that eventually our daughter will want to know why her birthmom does not show much interest in her and always seems to be having a crisis. I do think that a conversation about putting the girls first is probably coming. I doubt that this will really hit home. She really does live such a drama that she has trouble functioning. I would never cut off contact unless I felt A was in danger, but I would not hesitate to reduce contact if I feel that A is being hurt emotionally by the visits. It is hard, because she is my daughter's birthmom, she is part of our family and we love her. I just keep in mind that helping too much enables her to continue making bad choices. we have chosen ways to help that we feel are in her best interest and in the girls best interest. Good luck, this is one of the hard things about some open adoptions. I still believe it is the best way for children who are adopted to grow up, but boy is it work sometimes. Becky  \n",
      "Hi. We have three children through adoption all with different levels of openess with birthfamilies. With our first adoption I really did not think we wanted much openess and neither did his birthparents. Over the years my son has struggled with the questions that we do not have the answers to. Recently he did make contact with his birthsister and most of his birthfamily (not the birthparents themselves though) It has been so helpful for him, at nine years old to get to know these folks. I think in the begining we are so focused on finally getting on with being a family, that the reminder of the birthfamily is somewhat painful, but even if you were never to see any of them ever again, they will in some way, always be a part of your extended family even if that is not your intention. I don't think two phone calls in the first week is a lot. Especially if the two of you became close. She probably sees you as a friend and as such expects that you are concerned about her. I can't imagine what it must feel like to carry a baby for nine months and then walk away empty handed. With our third adoption the birthmom wanted more openess and by that time we were more comfortable with the idea. Even though she saw our daugher the first week and we spoke on the phone several times and the visits continued on a fairly regular basis, she tells me now that she was still not sure if she had done the right thing until she came to our home on A's first birthday and saw how our family lived and treated her birthchild firsthand. I know different people have different comfort levels with open adoption and I am not trying to make you feel badly for not wanting more openess. I just want to let you know that the level of openess you want for your son might change if he someday feels pieces to the puzzle are missing. Don't shut the door on possibly changing the level of openess in the future. Becky  \n",
      "my 2 1/2 year old daughter talks about her birthmom and certainly knows her when we see her. We have had visits about 3 mo. apart since she was born. We also have pictures of her b-mom and of her with her b-mom from infancy forward for her to look at. When she went through the big stranger anxiety at about 18 mo. I know this hurt \"N\" becasue she wanted nothing to do with her, and even now, she is excited when we see her but she reacts to her b-mom almost identical to the way she acts with my niece (her cousin) They are about the same age, dress similarly and interact with her in a similar way. My daughter knows her cousin well, she babysits a lot, so I think this helps ease the way with B-mom. I would never tell her this though as I'm sure she would feel sad. I know some day they will have a special realtionship, but many times A simply ignores her b-mom when she is around right now. I'm sure that must hurt. Becky  \n",
      "Our daughter's b-mom had another baby 21 mo. after A was born. We were able to give her all of our baby stuff and pass down clothes as she has outgrown them. of course her 1/2 sister weighs almost as much as she does and she is only 9 mo. old so I suppose there won't be too many clothes passed down from now on.  \n",
      "Okay, so I am at my MOPS group this morning and the talk turns to adoption. The woman next to me asks, do you do the open adoption thing? I figure great, here is a good chance to educate someone. I go into detail about how it works, feels and why (for the benefit of our children) we work so hard at it. She just stares at me through my disertation and then says, but aren't you afraid they will change their minds and take them back? I have heard this before so I go on to explain that the birthparents relinquish their paretntal rights fairly soon after placement and have no legal claim to the child. She then informs me that they do indeed have three years to reclaim their child. Okay, I tell her, no... as long as everything is done legally and there is no coersion involved, both birthparents are identified and freely choose to relinquish, that this does not happen. My kids, are legally, my kids. Well, she just stared at me as though I have no idea what I'm talking about (after all I have only gone through this three times, what the heck would I know). I left there feeling SO frustrated. How can you educate people when they are not listening!?!?!?! I think the worst part of the whole ordeal was that she seemed to insinuate that because we have open adoptions that this somehow makes it more likely that our children's birthparents will just somehow ask for them back one day and we will be powerless to stop it. AAAAAKKKKK!!!!!! Becky  \n",
      "I just kind of walked away shaking my head. She did indeed try to site some famous cases. I responded that in rare cases when adoptions have not been done in a legally correct way this has happened but that this is the very rare exception. I guess it was just frustating that she at first seemed to be really interested in open adoption and then it turned into just another lecture from another uninformed person about why it is so dangerous to know \"them\" All the while I'm trying to point out that \"they\" are the reason I am a parent and that my children exist. 79nic: You gotta laugh sometimes! Hey, sorry to hear you missed getting her back by only a few months. Maybe if you just asked Marie's parents they would give her back, they could not have bonded that much in three years ;) Becky  \n",
      "Hi. My oldest son, has always been super sensitive to things, sounds etc...he has outgrown many things but others always pop up. He is also very bright, very demanding and extremely defiant. He is almost nine, but has always had these traits to some degree. (at home, not at school) He was placed with us at six days old. We know there is a drug history with birthmom. He has been having terrible anxiety attacks the last year or so. We have been seeing a psychologist and he says B is doing great and progressing very quickly with his treatment. We have discussed anxiety meds. and have wanted to avoid them. The psychologist got to see an attack on Monday and has asked us to use a medication which is not long term but is supposed to help when he has an attack. We agreed to try it and I will pick it up today. I myself have had anxiety in the past as well as my mom and best friend. So I know alot about how it feels. Right now I guess I just need to hear from others who have had this as a child or now have a child expeiencing it. Does the anger and defience go with this or is it just part of his personality? They say the drug use could be playing a part in this. We have also cut out most sugar and lots of white bread which is helping and I have spoken to a woman about doing some biofeedback. Does anyone have expeience with that? We have been dealing with this for awhile now, and I guess I just also need some extra support and prayers. It affects everything we do as a family and everything is a struggle, battle, fight, arguement for our family. It is taking it's toll on all of us. I think it is getting better...but two steps forward one step back... Becky  \n",
      "Dadfor2: Thanks for the reply. I did post on the special needs site about this some time back and got a little response. I firgured if I posted here too I might get some of the responses from people that this affected as children who may not visit that site as they themselves don't have special needs children. As I have not picked up the medicine yet, I don't have the name. the psychologist consulted with our pediatrician and she in turn contacted a child psychiatrist that she says she really trusts to choose the medication. Spacemonkey, I am glad that you now have a correct diagnosis. I think because I have suffered from anxiety it was pretty apparent to me what was happening to him. I could feel his fear and that is no way to live! I want him to have a happy childhood and good teenage years (as much as that is possible). As I said, he is making good progress. At the start of the school year I had to walk him into his class each day with him falling apart, now I can drop him off from the car and he kisses me, smiles and barely looks back as he goes to join his friends. It is now the unexpected things that set him off. We are going on a trip next week for Thanksgiving and I know his Psychologist was thinking that it might be hard on him so thus the into of meds at this time! Becky  \n",
      "lorraine: I understand about the medication evening him out. As I said I have had experience myself with anxiety. When we were going through all of our infertility issues I took such a medication for about a year. It helped me to regain control and sort things out, but I hated that I never felt real joy or even real sorrow. I was lucky, that my anxiety seemed to be situational and I was able to get off the medication and have remained pretty much anxiety free for many years now, and it was helpful that when he started describing how he felt, I had felt that too and could say, Yikes I think I might know what is going on! Can you tell me how this has affected your other children? Are all of your children adopted? Do you think their is a biological link? I remember when B was about 4 and he had some episodes he described as feeling dizzy. I now believe it was starting even then. Many of the things that set him off are as irrational as your rain issue. Any weather warning in the entire state causes sheer panic here, he has a fear of heights/open spaces. After repeated exposure to a place or situation he can ususally cope, but as I said uexpected things are the worst and as we al know, life is full of unexpected things! Thanks for your reply. Becky  \n",
      "What is interesting about my son is that no one would ever label him with add. He is an outstanding student, bright beyond his years and his grades, behavior and attetions span at school prove that. He constatly performs above grade level and in fact reads at above a 7th grade level (he is in third) He has always been this way with an incredible vocabuluary by 2 and the ability to pick out numbers before his second birthday. I often wonder if his intelligence adds to the anxiety because he is capable of understanding so much but is not yet able to process it above his emotionaly appropriate 8 year old level. Because he was placed with us at six days old, I know there is not a history of neglect or abuse, but have explored the idea that his life in the womb has contributed to his issues. So much happens before birth that we just don't understand and I know his birthmother was not living an ideal lifestyle for a pregnant woman. As to the medication, I am hoping that we can use it to help him be calm long enough to learn other strategies to help him cope in the world. As I said, he is doing well with his pshychologist and he understands and admits that he has a problem and is willing to get help, talk about it and do the work toward feeling better. As the Dr. said to us, he sees some kids who won't even admit there is a problem for the first year, our son went in knowing and admitting that there is a problem. Becky  \n",
      "Dadfor2: the anxiety attacks don't really happen at home, it's the explosive, defiant behavior that occurs here. School was an issue anxiety wise last year and earlier this year, but he still did well academically. The principal at the school died last year and that just sent B over the edge. The anxiety happens pretty much anywhere else that is new or involves a height or open space. We just never know when it will happen. As for school work it is kind of effortless for him so far. He is not really a perfectionist and neither are we. He set his own goals at his conference this year, as the teachers have it set up that way and they so far have been easily attainable for him with little infput from us. At home, the other kids, both younger, are pretty easy to get along with, don't cause him much trouble and they all seem bonded and attaced to each other. We try hard to make sure everyone gets there own attention and that everyone feels special. Although, trust me, he gets his fair share of attention as he is impossible to ignore when raging at everyone and everything. My background is in early childhood education and trust me, over the last 15 years I have dealt with all kinds of issues with children. I know that they act out at home because they feel safer there, it does not make it any easier knowing this when he is out of control. Lorraine: I think ahead a lot to the time when B will be 6 feet tall and I will not be able to make him do anything. I worry about my other kids for several reasons the biggest of which is that his outbursts are scary, they are loud and seem out of control. He does not hurt anyone but the sheer volume is unbelievable. Becky  \n",
      "About a year ago my boys talked me into a can of spider man web (silly string in disguise). I finally had to paint over the remainder of it on living room ceiling this spring, and if you look closely you can still see it up there. Oh...and in the way of additional warning, my sister in law bought the kids some Nickelodian Gooze for Halloween and contrary to what the directions say, it DOES NOT wash out of anything with warm water. I think she was paying me back for all the obnoxious stuff I bought my nicece and nephew all those years! Becky  \n",
      "My husband's sister used to put confetti in every card she sent. Eventually I would carefully open them over a trash can and \"dump\" them out before opening anything she sent. It was cute at first and then became annoying! Becky  \n",
      "My boys are 8 and almost 6. They had their own rooms until about a year ago when our oldest started having nightmares and we discovered (by accident) that when little brother was having a sleep over he stopped having the dreams. We just finished our basement and they moved down there together. One bedroom, a bathroom and a play/study/tv/game room. I could not believe that they moved all the way down there and did not believe it would happen until it did. But they feel so safe and secure together that it has worked great. (I am the only one with separtation anxiety) but I am getting over it. My dad said all along that the boys should share a room, but I thought I was being a good mom providing everyone with their own space. It was hard sometimes with it being the oldest's room first he would say \"get out of my room\" when he was mad. Now that they have a room that is theirs together that does not happen! Becky  \n",
      "I have heard almost all of the comments mentioned here at one time or another. Currently the ones that get me are related to our open adoption situations. I can't tell you how many times people have said, what if they want him/her back when they spend time together? Well what if they do? It is not a choice. they are legally our children. It's not like nine years later someone says, you know, I really had fun with B today, I would like him back, could you drop him off at 2:00? That whole Lifetime movie thing has really screwed things up for all of us. Drives me nuts! Becky  \n",
      "With our oldest son's adoption, I could not imagine the birthfamily knowing where we lived etc.. Now... three kids later, at least some member of each birthfamily knows where we live and my daughter's birthmom has even visited overnight. I think the most important thing is to only promise what you KNOW you can deliver on. Open adoption is like other relatioships in some ways. They evolve over time. If someone had told me that it would be ME who wanted more openess when we first became aparents, I would have told them they were crazy. But as time went on, I began to see the need of the birthfamilies in my childs' (and yes even our) lives. Let the birthfather know what you can promise and stick to no matter what. Add that your level of openess might change as time goes on, but make no promises. When we chose guardians for our children should we die, I made sure that when we asked our friends, that we spoke about the importance of the children manitaining contact with their birthfamilies and this is even written into our wills with all important information relating to their adoptions. Maybe you should consider who you would ask to be a guradian, have this conversation with them and then you could reassure the birthfather that should anything happen to you, that he would not be left our of the child's life. Good Luck! Becky  \n",
      "I like the crock pot too. One favorite is: A package of beef short ribs. Salt, pepper and brown in a skillet. Place two cans of beef broth in the crock pot, a half of a sliced onion (if you like onion) and then add the meat. Cook on low all day. Serve with buttered wide egg noodles. Stew in the pressure cooker is another favorite. Brown stew meat and a chopped onion, add a large can of tomatos, four large potatos (cut the way you like), a small package of baby carrots and pressure cook for twenty minutes. Thicken with milk and flour. I have friends who are afraid of my pressure cooker, but once you learn how to use it, you can cook things super fast. Becky  \n",
      "When I saw the subject of your post I wondered if I had walked in my sleep and posted it myself. My son has different issues. He started experiencing horrible anxiety last year and has always had lots of fears. He is also argumentative, angry and down right hateful at times. He picks on his five year old brother and and is relentless when it comes to being \"right\" about something. He is actually better with me than his dad. He is vert bright but has to be pushed to do his best at school. He has seen the school psychologist and is now seeing a psychologist reccommended by our pediatrician. I really like him and so does my son. He knows he needs help. We are year around and they have been off (this is the last week). I can't wait for school to start again. He IS driving me crazy. My back ground is in Early Childhood Education and I have worked with many, many children with serious behavior issues and this has not helped me much at home either. What does help is the sleep thing. Of course GETTING him to sleep is a battle. Getting him to eat right (another battle) alone time (which he hates). The Game boy, play station and computer have been taken away, because he becomes belligerant after being sucked into the video void even for a short time. Of course he is super angry about this as he loves to be sucked in and then treats us all like crap after he is done playing. I feel for you. Becky  \n",
      "It is SO hard to see this when you are living the painful part. I remember wondering Why. Of course now I know why. I could not imagine NOT being mom to the three kids I have. I have a dear friend who is now living the painful part. She has miscarried twice after years of not feeling worthy to be a mom at all. Now, she and her husband are being considered by a birthfamily (that I got them involved with) and it is not looking like they will be chosen. I have tried to share this feeling that if it is not meant to be, then keep trying, that her baby will come how and when it is God's time. I hope they continue to have hope, even if the current situation does not work out. Thanks for reminding ME that I can plan all I want to. It is HIS plan, HIS will for my life that will come to pass and that will be what I am made for. Becky  \n",
      "Okay, I guess I understand the premise here. For me that would have been totally unrealistic. When my oldest son was placed I had ten days off and then returned to work as a Preschool Director. I had him with me. I had turned my office into a nursery. My co-director and lots of great mommies helped me out those first few weeks and months. with my second and third I took all the help I could right from the start. My children are completely 100% bonded to my dh and I and always have been. We did the majority of feeding, changing, comforting and holding with all of our kids but other family and friends were right there from the start to offer their love and support and I don't think it hurt anyone.

      "About two weeks ago my son's birthsister started e-mailing us. She is 16 my son is 8. We had been sending our e-mail address to his birthmom for about a year. Anyway, we met her and his b-Grandma last week and were invited to their annual family picnic yesterday. At first b-Grandma made it sound like she would like us to drop him off to meet all of these strangers. Yeah right. We made it clear that our entire family would be happy to meet everyone. It went really well. I thought he might be overwhelmed but they handled it well and so did he. I think it was good for them to see us all as the family we are. His birthmom was not there and has some problems in her life right now. I hope she does not feel betrayed by us that we accepted contact from her family. It was interesting to see people whose faces and actions I had imagined over the years (a little scary too if I'm being honest here). But it was good for my son. He was so happy to meet everyone. Becky  \n",
      "This was his first contact. My middle son sees his paternal birth grandparents and some cousins once in awhile and we have a very open adpotion with my daughter's birthmom and her family. So I'm really glad for this contact, I know he was feeling left out. Asking \"why doesn't anyone from my birthfamily ever see us? I'm finding out that open adopiton is like any relationship and requires work. It also changes with time, and like my own family, I sometimes don't approve of things they do or say, but keep my mouth shut because they are a permanant part of my life (and I'm sure I too say and do things they think are nuts!)

I started giving my kids multiviatmins at 2 because that is when they all slacked off on the veggies and my pediatrician told me to start the vitamins.

      "Hi! They are all so different. My background in in Early Childhood Education. At twenty months I would not get to worried. Is his receptive language good? Does he seem to hear what you are saying? Can he follow a direction like pick up the ball or where is the doggie? Can he communicate in other ways to get his needs met? Also, if he had a history of bad ear infections I would seek a referral from his pediatrician for an evaluation. Otherwise I would read, sing and talk talk talk. Becky  \n",
      "They started e-mailing this week and we decided to meet today. We met at Chuckie Cheese and did not tell my son until we got to the parking lot as he would have been a nervous wreck. It was a very emotional meeting for us all. My son is 8 and we have had no contact with anyone since placement. He was a little overwhelmed but did great. He got to see more recent pictures of his b-mom and lots of b-relatives. I think we are going to their annual picnic next Sunday to meet more of his b/family. It was especially nice though to meet his sister. She is 16 and has no other sibs. from either side. You could tell this meant alot to her. Her mom is not in a good place in her life and that is the down side, but we did find out that she has gotten all of our pictures and letters over the years which was a huge relief. What a day!

      "As some of you know, my oldest son's birthmom asked for pictures and letters but we were told they had not been picked up (in the 8 1/2 years we have been sending them). Well...aparently someone at the agency was confused because the day before yesterday when I opened my e-mail I had one from his birth sister. I almost fell off of my chair. She said that she wanted to get to know my son and that she had pretty much been raised by her Grandma and now lived with her dad (not the same bio-dad as my son). I wrote her back right away and when my son got home he read the e-mail, grinned like and idiot and wrote her back asking a ton of questions. She has written back and I think we will meet her and his bio-grandma sometime soon. She confirmed that her mom HAD gotten the pictures/letters and that she (the sister) had them in her scrapbook. The only downside is that I got the feeling his birthmom is not in a great place right now and I don't think meeting her will be an option at this time. I have tried to ease this information on him. I hope that at least meeting someone in his birthfamily will help to answer some of the ten million qusetions he has without overwhelming the sister. She seems pretty mature. Thanks for letting me share this news. We are cautious, but excited! Becky  \n",

Ok, I figured she is wet. So...when I fianlly get around to changing her I realize she really does need a diaper as she has taken hers off at some point. I ask her if she went potty (she has one in her room) and she says yes on the chair.

      "So sorry to hear about the loss of Raven. I remember having to put my little Tia to sleep about four years ago. We have other dogs now, that I love, but she was MY baby....and I can't imagine ever having a relationship like that with any other animal. About this sleep thing....all three of my kids started having changes in sleep at about that age. As they started crawling, pulling up and then walking as well as getting more and more words. Sleep just did not seem as important. I always made sure to give them the opportunity to nap and ususally they took it, even though not always as long as I needed ( : I too would put them to bed earlier if they did not get a good nap and got cranky. They always seemed to wake up at the same time too. At around 19-24 mos. everything seemed to fall into place again and they all slept pretty reugualarly during nap time and at night. My boys each gave up naps at around 4 years old. My daughter who is now two takes a good two hour nap and sleeps 11-12 hours at night. But I remember when all that new stuff was going on, I wondered if they would ever sleep again. Becky  \n",
      "When we adopted the first time I was worried about my dad. I knew he would never say anything to a child about his/her background but I also knew that he still carried some prejuduce from his youth and where he grew up (not an excuse but just where he came from) Our first son is 3/4 Hispanic and 1/4 CC our second son is 1/2 Hispanic, 1/4 AA and 1/4 CC Our daughter is 3/4 CC and 1/4 Cuban. As it turns out, my dad fell completely in love with my children. He is one of their biggest supporters and at times I think he treats them better than his bio-grandchildren. I do believe that you need to make sure you are prepared for a child of another race and that you are informed and personally committed to doing the work involved. But...for us, it was almost like God sent my beautiful children for many reasons, one of them being to teach my dad a lesson about human beings and love. Becky  \n",
      "Hi. With our sons, the b-moms knew they did not want direct contact only pictures and letters which we send, but they have never picked up. When our daughter was born, her b-mom knew she wanted more, but was not sure exactly what. I think it is important to listen to what she thinks she wants out of an open adoption and then decide what you are sure you will be comfortable with and let her know. Also tell her that you realize everyones thoughts and feelings might change after baby comes and as time goes by but that you will always keep your promises about what you are sure you can do. We were sure we could send pictures and letters every few months the first year and then every six monts from then on. We were sure she could have our cell phone and call when she needed, during daytime hours, as long as she knew sometimes calls would have to be returned. We knew we could have in person visits occasionally. What we could not know was that we would also be comfortable with her at our home, coming for A's birthday being involved with the new baby she now has. Babysitting for her (she has even asked us to be baby M's Godparents) she has stayed overnight at our house and we see b-mom's dad as well. We could not have imagined this to begin with, it seemed, well, weird and intrusive and would she try to co-parent? No, she clearly enjoys seeing A, but she treats us as the parents (which we are ( : If she did otherwise, I imagine our relationship probably would have stayed with what we were sure we could do and what we promised to do, but no more. Like any relationship an open adoption changes and grows over time. I think it is most important that you just remember to promise only what you can deliver on. A's b-mom is young enough to be our daugher, so it is still a little strange at times, but I really belive that God put us in each other's lives for a reason. Good Luck! Becky  \n",
      "With our oldest son, I was at work conducting a parent teacher conference when my friend ( the director) stepped in while I took \"The Call\" which told me about a baby boy who was two days old and could we be shown and were we interested? I'm sure the parents of the child I was doing the conference with thought I was an airhead when I returned and hurried them out of my classroom as quickly as I could. I was again at work two days later when they called to say we had been chosen and to bring a car seat two days later to meet B and his birthparents. One thing I never thought I would say is that I was skiing the day my child was born. With son number two we had been waiting only three weeks, we were told to expect a longer wait the second time. So when I was soaking in the tub and the phone rang I was a little stunned when dh came bursting in asking if we were interested in a baby boy born that day. We knew we were being shown, but she was not due for three weeks and went into labor that day instead. With our daughter, we were evacuated from our home because of the biggest forest fire in Colroado history. Staying at my mom and dad's house. We were three days away from heading to Disney Land with our sons for vacation ( I was a tad bit stressed out) I had gone to Mervyn's to get some last minute stuff when my cell phone rang as I was in the parking lot on the way back to my car. It was my husband saying our worker had called, and a potential birthmom had chosen us and wanted to meet us that Friday. We met her right before we climed in the car to head out. While she was due any day (I planned to fly back if she had her) she went over by almost two weeks. We were laying in bed at midnight when she called to talk to us while in labor. The boys and I were at the beach when we were called to come and meet our new baby girl! Becky  \n",
      "Well, tomorrow my baby turns two. I can't believe how fast time has passed. I painted her nursery big girl \"Dora The Explorer\" Pink today and put together a big girl Dora toddler bed. She is in it now, and I think asleep. She asked for the crib once but we talked about how special her new bed is and she seems to have bought it....for now. Tomorrow we will go have a bagel (her request) for breakfast and then go to the pool where her brothers have their swim lessons and she plays in the baby pool. Then we will go to the beach and picnic, have a nap and meet her birthmom, b-mom's boyfriend, their baby and birthgrandpa at McDonalds for hamburgers, climbing and cake. I am feeling a little sad tonight that the crib has come down, possibly for the last time. But I feel so blessed to have such a special \"big two year old\" as my daughter! Becky  \n",
      "Hi guys. After reading your posts, I feel kind of, well, mean. With all three of mine I just took down the crib, put up the toddler bed and put them in it. The adjustment took a few days and that was that. My daughter has been in hers two nights now. I put a tall gate at her bedroom door so she doesn't wander the house or fall down the steps (which also has a gate). She woke early each day. Yesterday she came in and slept with us for the last few hours. Today I went to her, tucked her back in and we talked about how it was not time to get up yet, she went back to sleep. As I recall this is how it went with the boys too, and within a few days they were fine. they had a race car bed which they loved and she has a Dora bed, her favorite, with new sheets and a newly painted room. which she is very excited about. I'm sure it would have been different if we had co-slept. I tried to have them in our room when they were little, but I woke at every sound and was a mess, I could not even use a monitor because I could hear them WITHOUT one from our room to theirs. Guess I'm a freak. Could you try having nap time in the big bed first? That might make the tranisition to night time easier. Good luck! Becky  \n",
      "Deb, I hope that the sleeping continues for you. I'm glad that our daughter does not have company at this time in her room. After about five nights she is finally into a routine where she lays down and goes to sleep and stays that way all night. She had a liitle trouble the first two nights and it has gotten better each night. We had to really darken her room. It is on the east side of the house and before when the sun woke her up in the crib she must have just gone back to sleep, but...with this bed she was hoping right up. My boys now sleep a little later and I just was not into getting up with the sun. I hope you have a peaceful night at your house! Becky  \n",

      "Our youngest is two. I gave a lot of our stuff to her birthmom when she had her baby in April. I kept a few things for when she and other babies visit. I still have days when I think I would love a fourth, and then the three of them will each be needing my attention and I think, yikes would I have enough of me to give to a little baby? But getting rid of all that baby \"stuff\" was hard. It made it easier knowing that A's little sister would be using it and that they needed it desperetly. Becky  \n",
      "We have three children through adoption. We have always talked about how our family was formed and have pictures of birth parents etc... Our daughter's adoption is fully open. Her birthaunt is expecting a baby next month and at first we were considered as possible parents. Until...the baby's father decided that only a closed adoption would do and convinced the baby's mother that they should find a couple who would agree to keep the adoption from the baby (quite probably because he has an ex-wife and four kids that he does not want to know about the baby). So...they chose a family and supposedly, according to our daughter's birthmom, they have all agreed to wait to tell the child until they are 16!!!!! Can you imagine how horrible that will turn out? One of the biggest times of turmoil in one's life and you find our your parents have lied to you your whole life? It just makes us sick to think about it. This child will be our daughter's first cousin, we would have loved to have been it's mom and dad, but there would have been no secrecy. Our daughter's birthmom has tried to explain to her sister how terrible this will be for everyone, but the dad has convinced her it's the \"right\" thing to do. Yikes! It does still happen. What are people thinking? Becky  \n",
      "Hi. Our first son was placed with us at six days old so we did not get the hospital experience the first time. Our second son was born and we went to meet his birth mom the next day and to pick him up. This hospital basically ignorned our very exisitence. I don't think anyone even spoke to us except the b-mom, her friend and the agency social workers. It was creepy. The third time was better. When A was born the staff always talked to us and the b-mom. We were there several hours after birth, as per N's request. When she was discharged before the baby, because A was not eating well, and she had Doogie Howser as a doctor (his very first delivery alone), N made it clear that she wanted me in the nursery with A until she was able to be discharged. They did not like this too much but we had a nurse who had been there 26 years by that time and she was totally on our side, she advocated for b-mom's wishes and really worked with all of us. My suggestion would be to make sure b-mom is getting her needs met. N was young and it was hard to get her to talk about what she needed. So we kept asking her questions about what she needed and then making it happen. Another thing to keep in mind is that you will probably be feeling emotions that you could never imagine happening together. I thought I was prepared each time, and each time it overwhelmed me. To feel such joy for your family and the see and feel such sorrow for another family surrounding the same event is one of the oddest things I have ever experienced. Just be prepared to feel deep sadness for the birthmother's loss. Good Luck! Becky  \n",
      "Hi. We too accidently got birthparent information with our first son. We have done almost exactly the same thing. I have the information and will give it to my son when he turns 18, I also have it if there was some emergency reason to find the birthparents, medical or otherwise. One thing I did want to mention is that we made sure that the people we have chosen as guardians if something happens to us also know where this information is and how it is to be treated. If something happened to us, I would be really sad to see him lose the possibility of finding his birthfamily as well. It is a funny feeling to have gotton this information when you were not responsible for it. Most of the info. is \"burned\" into my brain and I could not forget it if I wanted to. Becky  \n",
      "My Webster's pocket dictionary defines real as \"actually existing, not counterfeit or assumed-true, genuine, sincere.\" It happened again today, a lady at church asked why my daughter is blonde and fair, while the boys are so dark. I answered that they were all adopted. Oh wow, so the boys aren't \"real\" brothers? she said. I replied that yes, they are very much real brothers, they are just not biologically related. AGGGGGGG!!!!!! I know I am (as my husband says) too sensitive about this \"real\" business. But hey, my family does, acutally exisit they are true and genuine. The kids play together, whisper secrets, worry about each other when one is hurt or in trouble, they fight and wrestle and tell each other to shut up sometimes. They tattle on each other, defend each other against other kids and can be truely, deeply, sincerely hateful and loving with each other. I am also real. I really lost tons of sleep when they were infants. I sincerely agonize when they are sick or hurting, I genuinely worry about their well being now and in the future. The thousands of diapers I have changed and the buckets of barf I have cleaned up certainly smelled real. The tears I have shed for my children and their birthfamilies are not counterfeit. The laughter I share daily with my family is genuine. The meals I prepare each day, the nagging I do about homework, chores,bath taking, manners, thank you notes and going to church are sincere as well. The reality is that we are a family. A real family. I am not biologically related to my husband, yet he too is really related to me. We exist! I know this woman did not mean to insult. She was not trying to upset me or hurt my feelings. Hopefully I gave her something to ponder a bit. She seemed so confused when I told her that yes, they are indeed real brothers. I will get off my soapbox now. Just had the REAL need to vent today! Becky  \n",
      "Feel free to use my definition any time you want! I am not always so sensitive, she just got me at the right moment I guess. My family has been pretty good about not saying anything like this, that would be worse coming from them. A good friends parents asked me shortly after our first adoption if I knew either of the baby's parents. I was totally confused for a moment, I am one of the baby's parents. The other thing that drives me nuts is when someones says (especially in front of my kids), how could his/her mother just give him/her away? OK in our house we have gone to great lenghts to only speak positively about our children's birthparents. We have always been open and honest, explaining as much as we know about the \"why\" of a placement. And....letting the kids know that while their birthmom could not parent any baby at that point, she CHOSE US to be their mom and dad. She did not \"give them away\" She gave them a family that she picked, and she did it because she loved her child, and it was hard for her and it was sad for her. to have a stranger callously talk about my children as though they were thrown away, and in front of them makes me want to scratch their eyes out. I can't even imagine what birthparents go through with crazy comments. I have had to defend all of my child's birthparents many times. When my daughter's birthmom had a new baby in April and we babysat, the people who knew who she was or who the boys told, kept asking, are you taking her too? Well, no, we are babysitting her. What do you mean? Why? Becacuse her mom and dad needed a babysitter???? What is with people? Becky  \n",
      "Lee Ann, your reply brought tears to my eyes. I hope that my kids birthparents are comforted in some way by knowing or sensing how much we love \"our\" children. I can't imagine any way that I could be more deeply connected to them. Thank you for your kind words. They are more important than all of the stupid comments I have ever heard! Becky  \n",
      "How funny. Just yesterday a woman (who knows my kids were all adopted) said \"so where are they from\" I said Colorado. She wanted to know if it was incredibly hard to adopt domestically and I said no, actually it was pretty darn simple for us. We looked into foreign adoption and it was more expensive and time consuming and seemed much more frustrating than what we went through. I have had some people tell me that the reason they did foreign adoption was to avoid having an open adoption relationship. My oldest boy is 3/4 Hispanic 1/4 German, my middle son is 1/2 Mexican 1/4 AA and 1/4 CC, my daughter is 3/4 German and 1/4 Cuban (a little fair blue eyed blonde) people ask all the time \"where we got them\" As if it is impossible that there are children right here in the Denver metro. area who need famlies. ????? Becky  \n",
      "Hi. The agency we used all three times does not like to match until near the end of a pregnancy. I know some here feel that they really like to build that relationship for awhile before birth and placement. Our agencies belief is that there are fewer failed placements the later they wait. Potential birthparents have more time to think about their decision and more time for counseling. Sometimes when a relationship is formed for a long time before the birth, birthparents may feel \"obligated\" and if they decide to parent it is much harder on them because they feel they are letting down someone whom they have a deep relationship with. This may seem good as a pre adoptive parent at first, but if you really think about it, you want to know that the birthparents of the child you are raising had every opportunity to decided to parent without guilt. I know there are cases where long term matches have been wonderful for everyone, it probably depends a whole lot on those involved. Our oldest son was several days old when his birthmom looked at profiles and chose us. son number two was due in three weeks when we were presented, she went into labor the next day and chose us after his birth. Our daughter was the only one whose birthmom we met before the birth. She was due in a few weeks when we met and were chosen. She was overdue by ten days, so we knew each other for almost a month prior to the birth. Anyway, I know that is some of the thinking as to why wait late to match. Good luck! Becky  \n",
      "We have had many people tell us how beautiful our family is. My favorite comment was from our daughter's birthmother who said not to long ago that when she is trying to explain where her first daughter is to people she tells them that we are all family. I said yes we are all realated through A. Becky  \n",
      "For our daughter's first birthday we had her birthfamily over on her birthday for dinner and cake and a celebration. We celebrated with my family several days later on July fourth when we all got together. We did it this way because I know my family and unfortunately they would probably be very uncomfortable with the birthfamily and may even react inappropriatly. My parents who are in their 70's and 80's are just never going to understand or participate in our open adoption. I have accepted this and want to minimized discomfort for my daughter's birthfamily. It is time to start planning birthday number 2 (I can't believe it) and we will probably do it the same way this year to. Becky  \n",
      "When we were trying to get pregnant we had all kinds of \"helpful\" suggestions. The worst was when several people that dh knew said \"do you need us to come over and show you how it is done?\" Lovely. We have also had the -now you will have one of your own for sure. ????what the heck does that mean? I also like- Do you know his/her parents? Well, yes actually I AM one of his/her parents. When we were in the hospital before our daughter came home almost two years ago, I was allowed in the nursery to feed her. On one occasion her birthgrandpa and I were going in together and one of the grandmas in the nursery waiting for her grandchild assumed that we were a couple of GRANDPARENTS. In all fairness he is only about 5-6 years older than I am, but she just wouldn't shut up, even as we tried to explain the situation she just was not getting it. My husband thought this was hysterical later, me, not so much. Becky  \n",
      "About a year after we were married we were at my dh's family Christmas party. One of his obnoxious Uncles came up and asked if I was pregnant. I was not. I had gained the 15lbs of first year of marriage and as I was a freshman in College I had gained those 15lbs too. He would not believe me as I had been quite thin before and like my paternal Grandma and Aunts I gain it all in my gut. He went on and on until I was almost in tears. Thank God I did not know we were infertile at the time. Honestly, I don't know what is wrong with people. Becky  \n",
      "Missy, your baby will be lucky to have such a wonderful mommy! By the way, there are plenty of people in my family who have had babies later in life (my mom and dad included) and while we are not rocket scientists, most of us are pretty darn healthy and bright. Congratulations again! Becky  \n",
      "Just thought I would share that my daughter's 6 week old birthsister is here tonight. We are babysitting her for the first time. My daughter was so darned excited (she is almost 23 months old). She wanted baby to cry, poop, eat, smile, burp and everything else all on comand before she had to go to bed. I finally had to wrestle her down for the night with the promise that baby M would be here all night and she would get to see her in the morning. I'm so glad these sisters will get to know each other as they grow up. Just thougth I would share! Becky  \n",
      "Hi. To tell you the truth we are thinking about one more little person. We have two boys 8 and 5 and our little girl. I think she would love to have a baby here. The boys are great big brothers too. We will see! Becky  \n",
      "While we were waiting to adopt the first time, we were briefly considered for two sisters 2 and 4, at the time, one of my close friends at work who is a full blooded Sioux Indian told me she did not think it would work out. She had a dream that we would adopt a baby boy with dark hair and it would be very cold outside. The night our son was born we did not know anything yet as his birthmom did not even look at profiles until after the birth, but...the night he was born we we awakened by a loud and distinctive knock on our bedroom door. We had a friend staying in our basement at the time and I thought it was her. I opened the door...nothing, I went downstairs and she was in her room fast asleep, the next day she said it was not her. It really freaked us all out. We did not think anything else about it until after we brought B home five days later (his hair was black and it was 3 below zero) I called my Sioux friend who had predicted this and also mentioned the knock for some reason, she went absoluetly still and said her mom always told her that when such a knock was heard, someone important was about to enter or leave your life. Someone important certainly did! With our second son, we were told it would probably take a lot longer (as number one took about two months). So when the phone rang three weeks later, and another little guy had been born with a very similar ethnic background and looking so much like the first that at times we get early pictures confused, we knew it had to be. With our daughter, we had not planned on a third adoption. After September 11th (which was also about the time she was conceived) I began to have overwhelming feelings that there was another baby out there that we were supposed to have. Our pastor preached on praying for the desire of your heart shortly after these feelings began. I prayed right then and there for a baby girl to come into our lives if that was what was supposed to happen. Within weeks we were matched with a birthmom who knew she was having a girl and our daughter was born several weeks later. I believe these were the children God intended for us to have in our family. Last weeks sermon was about prayer again and how sometimes when we pray the answer is no, but that God may have better things planned for us when He says no. I thought how often I prayed to be pregnant and how I would have missed out on these children that I can't imagine not having. He did know what was best for me. Becky  \n",

      "Hi. I remember on the way home from picking up our first son, looking in the backseat and thininking, oh my gosh they actually let us take him and drive away. We did not have bonding issues other than some worry that the birthparents might change their minds during the initial wait (while Colorado just changed it, the wait had been quite long before rights were relinquished, for our kids 6-8 weeks), this was a tough time, each time got easier, perhaps because I came to believe strongly that the children who were meant to be ours would come to us and stay with us when it was time. Our families accepted and bonded better than I ever imagined. As for feeling entitled, it was hardest with our daughter. We had only brief meetings with our son's birthparents (their choice). With our daughter we have an open adoption, where we met before the birth and have had fairly frequent contact after, it was the only time I ever felt like I was taking someone's child away. Don't get me wrong, the open adoption is working well for all of us, it is just that we got to really see the pain this birthmom went through on a long term basis. It's not that we forgot our boys birthparents, but since they did not want direct contact, we did not experience the pain. We are fully bonded and feel completly like parents to all three kids. Each experience was different and exciting. Becky  \n",
      "The first time I was 29 my husband 30 Birthmom was 26 Birthdad 27 Our son was six days old when we met No, she did not choose us until after she gave birth I send pictures and letters through the agency but none have ever been picked up. The second time I was 32 my husband was 33 Birhthmom was 27 birthdad 35 Our son was 1 day old when we met No, she chose the day she went into labor (three weeks early), we did meet at the hospital this time. Again, I send photos and letters and the adoption has been closed by the birthparents (reasons unknown to us). The third time My husband and I were both 36 Birthmom was 17 birthdad 25 (my husband and I have actually been together long enough to be HER parents.) We met three weeks before her due date (she was ten days late)While not at the hospital we did speak by phone during labor. We have a fully open adoption with her birthmom and letters/pictures with birthdad. Maybe if we choose to do this again, I will acutally make it into the delivery room. Becky :)  \n",
      "When I was a little girl, I always wanted a big family. Six kids I would say. Well, as infertility became reality years later, this dream kind of dried up. We now have three children through adoption. They are 8, 5 and 22 months. I did not think my husband would even consider another, but tonight he indicated that he too is at least thinking about it. My question is, with so many couples who are waiting for one child, is it selfish of me to want a fourth? I love being a mom, it is what I have always wanted. I know that it might take longer this time. I'm sure many birth parents are looking for childless couples or don't wish their child to be in a large family, but I'm equally sure that there are some who wish for a large loving family for their baby. What do you all think? With our daughter (number three) this feeling just came over me that we were supposed to adopt again and that feeling is back. Have I lost my mind? Becky  \n",
      "Thanks to those of you who have replied. I guess in reality I felt the same way, but you know sometimes the strenght of our own desires gets in the way of our own objectivity. I do believe that we would be able to love, nurture and care for another child. I know that some of the reason I asked this question is becasue not all of my family will be supportive (some thought we should have stopped at two and actually voiced that opinion). I also strongly believe that the children I have are meant to be in my family, thank you for reminding me of this! Becky  \n",
      "We asked my bil and his wife about 2 years ago. At the time they did not have kids but seemd like a good choice. They have since adopted a baby which again seems like a good thing in their favor. However, last summer we had them stay with our kids while we went away for three days. It did not go well. On the third day one of my oldest and best friends and her wonderful husband stepped in and took over. When I heard they were here from 1,000 miles away my relief was indescribable. At that moment, I knew we had probably made a mistake. We recently changed our wills with these friends as guardians (with their blessing of course). Good luck with your choice! Becky  \n",
      "This was a main criteria in who we picked. We made it clear that open relationships should be maintained and even wrote it into an addendum to our wills along with information we know about the boys birthparents when they are ready to search, and our daughter's in case contact is somehow cutoff (by birthmom) for some reason. I think you should casually bring it up that you had not thought about it, but then read this here and you are just having some concerns about openess continuing should something happen. Good Luck! Becky  \n",
      "My 21 month old daughter's birthmother is being induced today. She will be having another little girl and will be parenting her. I am having lots of feelings about this. My husband does not quite \"get\" all that I am feeling and frankly neither do I, so I thought I would share here where it feels safe and where I know some of you will be able to relate. My boys have sibs but we have no direct contact and no relationship, so I don't know them. A's birthmom and I have been developing our relationship since she was born. She has a very weak support system and we have grown closer since she has been pregnant. She even called the other night to tell me she is scared and ask if she can count on me for support (ie: what to do if baby won't stop crying etc...) her mother is unavailable and I feel I am in the position of an older sister or an Aunt. I completely want her to be successful with her parenting plan. She has many obstacles to overcome but I know she desperatly wants to be a great mom. Now...as to my feelings, I feel jealous because I have never been able to get pregnant. I feel sad, because we will know this little half sister but the girls won't grow up together. I feel afraid because some of her obstacles are scary to me, I feel happy that a new life is coming into the world and loving her first daughter like I do, I know this one will be equally as special. I try VERY hard not to judge her situation and have offered opinions and support only when asked and only what I think will be positive and helpful. I truely feel like God has placed me in her life for a reason. For both of us really. I just have a lot of mixed up feelings today. I wrote a short poem to which portays some of these feelings. Bear with me because I rarely share anything I write. Thanks for listening Becky.  Just Between Me and You My daughter becomes a big sister today... though not a new mom will I be. Her sis will come forth from her first mom... but oh how I wish it were me. The girls will not grow up together....not play house....share a room....or secrets. I feel sad for them both....and I know that thell be....some tears...and of course....some regrets. I love my daughter so much and I just know.....that I will love her sister too....Though she'll not be here....she will always be dear....this is just between me and you.  \n",
      "Hi! Last year for spring break we took our 7 year old son, 4 year old son and nine month old daughter and flew from Colorado to Orlando. We stayed outside the park and found this to be better as the lodging was cheaper as well as the food. We went to the Kennedy Space center, Daytona to see the NASCAR attractions (my husband is a huge fan), Sea World, the beach and Disney. This was a bit too ambitious but hey... My best tip would be to go early in the day and then go back to your lodgings in the early afternoon time and eat, sleep, swim, relax and then return in the evening so you get to see the parade, fire works etc... Also, we did pick one morning to have breakfast with the characters in one of the restaurants. It was a bit pricey but the boys still talk about getting to see the characters up close that morning in a non-hurried way and having their pictures taken with them. Have a blast. This year we got even braver and just returned Sunday from a week in Hawaii with the three of them! We figure, train them early to be good travelers. We went many places before kids and love sharing new experiences as a family! Becky  \n",

      "Morgan2, we were with an agency for two years that did NOTHING! We were never shown once to my knowledge. After we picked ourselves up from that situation and moved on to a new agency, I had my expectations set pretty low. The first time we adopted we finished our homestudy in December and had a potential birthmom look at our profile in early January, she decided to parent. Then a few weeks later, we got THE CALL. Would it be ok to show us? Of course! Our son had been born on Sunday, they called Tuesday, showed us Wednesday and we met his birthparents on Saturday and brought him home at six days old! The next time we thought it would take longer and were told to expect a longer wait. So...we applied at the beginning of November and after three weeks we got the call. Our son had been born that morning, in early December and we brought him home the next day. Number three, I could not imagine happening that fast again. My husband said yes, it will. And boom, we were chosen in only a few weeks after application in May, met the birthmom in June and brought our daughter home at one day old in July. So...in answer to your question, YES, it can happen that fast! Good luck with your journey. :D Becky  \n",
      "We did Classic Pooh for each of my son's. Everything was Winnie the Pooh. When deciding to adopt the third time my husband said only if I don't have to look at Winnie the Pooh for two more years. So...I chose one of my other favorite stories which is Rainbow Fish and did our daughter's nursery in that. It is also interesting that her b-mom is expecting her second baby girl in April and is doing...Winnie the Pooh. I was able to give her much of our our baby stuff (I kept the crib set since there is so much sentiment involved, and bought her her own for Christmas and her Birthday.) My Daugher will be two this summer and we ususally change themes at that point when they go into a toddler bed. Both boys used a race car bed, which I know she would love, but....those little girl toddler beds look so darn cute. Time will tell. Becky  \n",
      "With our daughter's birthmom I got her a journal and gave it to her at our intial meeting. When she placed our daughter with us at the hospital we gave her a nice silver heart locket (which she wears all the time.) Becky  \n",
      "My middle son and my daughter each had tubes put in around 16 mo. It was outpatient surgery and we were home shortly after noon. The worst thing about the whole surgery was that they could not eat aftermidnight the night before and both were pretty mad about that. I think the actual surger was harder on me ( a worry wort) than either child (: It made the world of difference for both of them. Both had almost continuous ear infections almost from birth. After the tubes my son has maybe had 3 in four years and my daughter has had only one this winter. I wish I had pushed harder for them for my oldest who finally outgrew the hellish cycle of infections at 3!!!! Becky  \n",
      "I was just wondering when, if ever the visits with the birth family feel truely comfortable. My two boys birthmoms did not want direct contact which I so regret now. My daughter's b-mom wanted visits but did not really know how often. At first we met in public places and she saw her about 5 or 6 times the first year. Birthmom never stated directly exactly what kind of contact she wanted and it was like pulling teeth to find out. Around Christmas of the first year she had moved again and I did not know how to reach her so I sent her pictures through the agency, with an update letter like I send the boys b-moms. This freaked her out as she thought we were closing the adoption. At that point I decided it was ridiculous that we were not communicating better and finally gave her our home phone address etc... On A's first birthday I invited her and her family to our home. Since then they have come several times, I have met them elsewhere once and I have given her all of our baby stuff as she is due with her second daughter this spring. She recently invited us to her baby shower as well and calls every four weeks or so. She does not currently have a number or I would call her as well. She and her boyfriend, and her dad came over for dinner tonight. It is still so uncomfortable at first. It is like pulling teeth to get them to talk and I am exhaused keeping a converstion going (no help from my husband who seems be content just letting me carry it) My question to those of you who have been at this for awhile is, how long did it take for you to feel really at ease with each other? I think some of it does have to do with age. Her dad, at 44 is only 5-6 years older than my husband and I, and we do have more to talk about. I try not to be \"mothering\" toward her, but have to fight it, as dh and I have been together long enough to BE her parents. Ideas for ice breaking at our next visit? Thanks for listening to me ramble a bit tonight. I am always busy over analyzing everything after a visit. Becky:)  \n",
      "Thanks for the replys. Yes, I am happy to hear from both amoms and bmoms! I know that I need to be more open and direct with A's bmom. I'm sure some of it is that I want her to like me too and I don't want to bring up anything potentially painful. I do think that after she has the baby we will have more to talk about. I also have considered that the time she wishes to spend with us may decrease after the baby. I think she and I need to spend some time together without her boyfriend, dad, sister etc... where we would be able to talk without everyone else around. We try to back off and let A and her just be together during visits but there is always someone else with her and she is very standoffish with our daughter even when her dad and her sister and boyfriend are playing with her. I don't know weather she is afraid she will hurt our feelings or if she is scared to form a closer realtionship with A or if fear of rejection is the issue. Again, as Mara said of course birthparents have fears too and I really need to lay it all out there and try to help us all better understand each others feelings. BTW A's birthmom has always been very respectful of boundries, almost overly so. I feel sometimes that she is afraid of forming too close a realationship with our family for fear that it won't last. GinnyBinny, It does seem that the more close together we meet the easier it is. I wish she would write to us but that is not her thing. Regina, I am working on this silence is ok thing. It is one of my problems. I talk too much and silence sometimes makes me uneasy. Thanks again! Becky  \n",
      "With our boys, the first was four days old when we were chosen, the second was born the day b-mom viewed our profile. Our daughter's b-mom was due in about two weeks when we met her and she chose us. The agency we worked with all three times does not like to match couples with b-parents until sometime near the end of the last trimester. They told us that it gives b-parents more time for counseling and soul serching and that is somewhat lessens the risk for a-parents. Of course we knew that the b-moms still had time to change their minds, but I think I might have gone mad pondering that for six months or more before the baby was even born. Becky  \n",
      "In Colroado what you are refering to is called a designated adoption. Most agencies fees are much less for this type of adoption. We used Small Miracles, but their fees are high. Others on the Colroado forum have spoken of Adoption Alliance very positively so you may wand to check with them. Becky  \n",
      "Valerie, I don't think anyone can say who a potential birth mother will or will not pick. I have read lots of posts on the forum from b-moms who talk about just this thing. They chose a-parents based on what they wanted for their babies. The reasons are as different as every individual. We were with a local agency for over two years and they never had a potential b-mom show any interest in us. I beleive now that they were not too interested in trying to match us at all. We met with and independent consultant who gave us some other agency options and we moved on. We were matched and placed within two months and our second two placements were equally quick. Did these people who made such a callous statement give you any feedback as to why they felt you would not be chosen? Many people meet through the internet these days so I can't imagine that interfering with your chances, and even if it turned someone off, it may spark something with another potential birth-mom and make you more attractive, you just can't tell. The process is hard and long, I know that after two years I wondered if maybe we were not supposed to be parents or if we anyone would ever choose us. I now believe that it was not time. I can't imagine not having the three beutiful children that I do. If you feel in your heart that you are meant to be a mom, do not give up hope. Becky  \n",
      "If we had waited for all rights to be relinquished, our children would have been in foster care for between 6weeks and three months. That is how our state law worked until recently. We were willing to take the chances in order to bond with and love our babies. If the birthparents had changed their minds, it would have been devastating, but I had to believe that for that time, those babies were where they were supposed to be. The birthmothers also did not want their babies in foster care for months while the process drug on. I think it helped them to see us take that chance in order to give \"our\" children the best start. Scary? Heck yes! Few things in life really worth it are without fear and risk. Becky  \n",
      "Finalization is such a great time. We have been through it three times and it is always such a happy time. In our state we had a court date and brought our lawyer with us. A rep. from the agency also came to present information about the placement and to reccommend us for finalization to the judge. The judge checked the paperwork and stated that the child was legally free for adoption. Our lawyer and/or the judge asked us simple easy to answer questions about our lives, the placement, finaces, how the child had changed our lives etc... The judge explained that this child now had all of the rights and we the responsibilities as if the child had been born to us, asked us to verify the name we had chosen and then approved the finalization. We took photos with he judge and then went to the clerk to pay for and order the new birth certificate and get our copies of the final adoption decree. All in all, each finalizatio took about thirty minutes total. We had about ten family and friends with us each time and celebrated afterwards with a breakfast out. Enjoy this special time with your little one and congratulations again! Becky  \n",
      "The first time we got \"the call\" I was in the middle of a parent teacher conference. I took the call and went back to finish the confernce. I'm sure the parents of that child thought I was the biggest air head in the world, all I wanted was to get them out of my classroom and call my husband. Brenden had been born three days earlier and our profile was shown to his birthparents the day before. We met his birthparents on Saturday and picked him up about two hours later at our social workers home. We had not told any of our familiy that we had a potential match, and boy was my mom excited when I called to tell her \"your a Grandma!\" With Ian, we had only applied three weeks earlier and were set in for the long haul of a wait. Our worker had talked to my husband on Dec. 2nd saying their was a potential birthmom who was due on Dec. 24th that they would like to present our profile to. So when I was soaking in a bubble bath (one of my favorite places to be!) on the next day, Dec. 3rd and the phone rang, I did not think anything about it. A few minutes later my stunned husband came in and told me that A: we had been chosen, B: our son had been born at about 11:00 that morning and C: could we go to the hospital and pick him up the next day, to say I was shocked would be putting it mildly. This time it was my boss who was surprised when I called to tell her I could not come to work the next day because I had a new baby! The thrid time, I was sure would take longer, my husband was sure it would be just as quick. A month after application our worker called my husband to say we had been chosen, the potential birthmom was due in a week and could we meet her in a few days? My husband called me on my cell and I was standing in Kohl's parking lot in shock. At the time, we were evacuated from our home due to the huge, raging, Colorado forest fire less than seven miles from our home, AND we were scheduled to leave with our boys to go to Disneyland the day we were to meet the p-birthmom. We met her that day, got right in the car and went to Californina (with the undersanding that I would fly back and my husband would drive if she delivered while we were there.) She was three weeks late and we brought Amy home the day after she was born. As a bonus, she was born in the same hospital as Brenden, so he got to see where he had been born, they even let him come into the nursery with us! Each call was memorable for many reasons and I do remember tiny little details about each one! Thanks for starting this thread and bringing back such happy memories! Becky  \n",
      "Hi! My mom was 38 and my dad 42 when I was born. I am going to be 38 in April and they are both still alive and well. I never felt cheated. On the contraty, by the time I came along my parents were calmer, more secure in who they were, were more financially secure and had more time to spend with me. My husband's parents were very young when they had their kids. They had four by the time my mother in law was 25. My husband questioned my sanity when I wanted nuber three at 36 as his experience was that this was old to be starting with another baby (his mom was 38 when we met!) I think alot of it has to do with your perspective on life. If you feel young, take good care of yourselves and stay involved and active with life I think babies in your forites are just fine! I know young couples who seem very old and vice versa. It is all a state of mind. Becky PS: I would go for number four in another year or so, but pretty sure my hubby is done. But...you never know(:  \n",
      "HI! For me going from one to two was the hardest. My son was just under three when we adopted his brother. I had been able to spend so much time with the first that it was emotionally difficult to spread myself out with two. By the time our daughter came along, the oldest was six and the youngest was 3 1/2. Because everyone was pretty use to sharing time and resources by this point, I think it was easier. I just had to get into a routine with the three of them. (and I learned to avoid shopping with more that one at a time...) I think it was a little harder for my husband. He is the oldest of four really close together. He felt ignored and pushed aside a lot as a child and wants to make sure we are giving everyone what they need. It is really great to have that perspective as I was the spoiled only girl and youngest with two MUCH older brothers! Becky  \n",
      "I have been thinking about you this last week. Following your journey to parenthood, and praying that this would be it. I was so relieved to see that everything has worked out. Keep us all posted on the joys of being a mommy. Becky  \n",
      "Hi! I was just getting ready to reply to a thread I believe you started on the Colroado board when I read this! We went through your agency all three times. I understand they are a little slow right now and that is what I was going to let you know on the other thread!!!! My brother-in-law and his wife finished their homestudy in early fall and had a placement on Dec. 7th with this same agency. You are in my thoughts and prayers. If you need someone to talk to about the agency or any of the feelings that go along with this process, please feel free to e-mail me privately or post on the Colroado board. Again, so happy for you! Becky  \n",
      "I've been following everyone's news. So happy for you!! Boys are tons of fun. How lucky you four are! What a wonderful Christmas present. God Bless Becky  \n",
      "Stacy, we have an open realtionship with our 16 mo. old daughter's birthmom. When she called several months ago to tell us she is expecting another baby in the spring I had so many mixed feelings. The father of this baby is different and in a better place, but many aspects of their lives are very unstable. I guess the hardest thing for me to think of is how my daughter's sister or brother will grow up and that I so hope things turn out well for the child. Toward this end, I have done a lot of praying for them all. In addition, I have offered all of our baby things (which have been happily accepted) and an ear to listen whenever she may need it. I guess I want my daughter to see that in life, circumstances often dictate choices, and that her birthmom's circumstances are different at this time. Also, I think if I am honest, as an amom, I do feel some jealosy that pregnancy seems to come so easily to some folks. I believe that I have worked through most of my infertility issues, but, as I am human, some of those thoughts never completely dissapear. Becky  \n",
      "If you are not certain that you are ready for baby number two, please wait! Going from one child to two is a big adjustment even when everybody is on board for the transition. I have friends with children who are quite close together and while they have lots of great fun at times,and there are benefits, it is lots of work, especially if you have little help from your husband. How long did your first adoption take? Will you use the same agency? What are their time frames currently looking like. Our first adoption happened quickly, placed in two months. We were told the second usually takes a lot longer, it took three weeks. Luckily we had waited until we felt we were ready. The third adoption took a month, so you just never know. Make sure you are ready to give up some of your time with your daughter before you move toward another adoption. There is just no way around it, babies take time, and you will have less for your big girl. Enjoy this time with your daughter. You are young and have lots of time to adopt again. What do you think is behind your husbands push to adopt now? Are his brothers and sisters close in age? Take care of yourself! Becky  \n",
      "Congratulations! With our oldest son we had been with the first agency for two years and they did nothing. When we changed agencies I figured it would also take forever and had little ready. From appliction to placement was less than two months. When the agency called, our son was already two days old. We were matched on a Wednesday and brought him home on Saturday. We spent $500 at Babies R Us on Friday night. It was stressful but wonderful! We also waited until baby was home for about 3 mo. and then had a potluck/shower where everyone could meet him, and by then we had a good idea about what we were really going to need. It is amazing how little you actually need those first few months. The next two placements were just as fast, but I was ready and waiting! Have fun and good luck! Becky  \n",
      "I will be thinking of you on Wednesday. It is truely a time for nerves, I've been there three times. I know it is hard to think this way, but I honestly believe that the baby you are suppposed to have in your family will come to you. If this is meant to be, it will happen. Becky  \n",
      "I don't have any sales people comments but always got a kick out of confusing people right after placement. I heard so many times (while out with a new little one and wearing my blue jeans), wow you look so great! How old is your baby? I guess I was bad but I did not educate anyone very ofter, just told them \"oh he/she is a week old\" etc... the looks on their faces!!!! Becky  \n",
      "Hi! With our first adoption I was very superstitious and after being with an agency that did nothing for two years, was not sure if it would ever happen. After we changed agencies I allowed my husband to put up the family crib and a border in the \"nursery\" even though I still was sure it would never happen. Less than two months later we got a call on a Tuesday and had our son by Saturday. The people at Babies R Us must have thought we were insane. With our second son I was much less superstitious, good thing as it happened in three weeks. By the time our daughter got here, I had everything ready, washed and waiting... that match and placement was also less than two months. I like the thinking of the grandma who pointed out that even in a pregnancy, nothing is guranteed. If you have faith that your baby will find you, there is no harm in being ready when he/she gets here. We had a familyand friends potluck for son number one three months after placement and that worked out really well. Then every one gets to meet the baby and by then you have a pretty good idea about what you will really need. Congratulations and enjoy every minute of it! Becky:)  \n",
      "Cathy, you always are SO positive, I love to read your posts! I too will be thinking of you and praying that the best choice for the baby is made! Keep us posted! Becky  \n",
      "Hi Cathy! How exciting for you! I know what you mean about knowing that God wanted you to adopt again sooner. We have two sons who are adopted (now 4 and 7). We had only planned to adopt two children. Not long after September 11th happened, I started having these overwhelming feelings that we were being directed to adopt again. My husband thought I had lost my mind at first, but soon came to understand how strongly I felt about this. We applied with the agency again that May. At our church we had a sermon about praying for the specific desire of your heart. I did. We were matched in June and had our beautiful baby girl placed with us on July 2, 2002 at one day of age. (She would have been concieved around the time that my feelings about another adoption began). I am so excited for you and to hear about how things go. As I know you believe, when it is meant to happen it will! Good Luck! Becky  \n",
      "I love talking baby names and nearly drove my husband insane coming up with names for our three children. Our oldest has his birthfather's middle name which also happens to be my brother's name. Our middle son's name was chosen with help from the birthmom. We presented our top two choices and she picked. She said it was important to her that we get to chose his name. Our daughter's birthmom picked out a name that I simply did not feel comfortable using. We agonized over picking a different name but finally decided on one and used her birthmom's middle name as her middle name. In the end she understood our reasons. All of our children's names were chosen also for their meanings. The oldest means Little Raven, the middle God is gracious and the baby's name means loved. For the record, my favorites on your list are Brynn and Aiden. Have fun making the choice!  \n",
      "Dear happy mom, congratulations on being matched. What an exciting and scary time for you! We have three children who are adopted. 7, 4 and 10 months. We met all birth Moms and two of the birth Dads. With our first, I had a lot of reservations about that initial meeting. I am so glad that we chose to meet the birth parents each time. It allowed them to feel more confident in their decision and it allowed us to ask questions and get pictures for our kids. I know that depending on the people involved, you may find out things you did not think you wanted to know. You may also find out some wonderful things to share with your child about their birthparents that you would never know from a form filled out. We found out both sorts of things, which will allow us to share all sorts of information with our kids. We do not have contact with the oldest's birth family, we have contact with our middle son's paternal grandparents, and we have regular contact with our daughter's birth Mom (all of this was by the birthparents choice.) All three birth Moms told us that while they felt we were the ones from our profile, that meeting us made them know that they had chosen well and that we were meant to be their babies family. We even met one birth grandfather at the hospital who was relieved to meet and talk with us. He said it eased his mind to have met us. All three experiences were very surreal and yet, they were powerfully emotional and I am so glad we met these women. Without them, I would not have my precious children to love and raise. And meeting them made us feel an even greater responsibility to do our best as parents because they were clearly placing a great deal of trust with us. My opinion may be slanted because we have only had mostly positive experiences with our match meetings, I know some others who have not, and I can't say how I would feel if I had a failed placement because of a match meeting. I do think that if something is meant to be, it will happen, and I can tell each of my children that I talked with their birthmom and I have some of the answers to questions they will ask ,straight from the source. My kids have pictures of us with their birth parents and two of them with us all together. I think this will help them to understand that their adoptions were a cooperative action between their birthparents and us, that in some way, we all were working together. Good Luck! 3inCO  \n",
      "All three of our kids have different levels of openess with their birthfamilies. originally I sent photos every other month the first year to our oldest and middle son's birthparents then twice a year. We have never had direct contact with them after placement (their choice) However, we now have contact with my oldest son's birthsister and grandma, aunts, uncles, cousins etc...We went to their family reunion and they have come to soccer games, today we picked up birthsister (16 yrs. old) and took her and our son to get a picture together for the birthfamily (especially the Grandma) for Christmas. My middle son sees his birthgrandma once or twice a year. She is somewhat stand offish, we are not sure why. She ususally calls around his birthday and always saves her older grandson's good used clothes for the boys. My daughter's adotpion is fully open with her birthmom. We talk to her frequently and see her about once a month on average. She is still pretty young and now has another daughter. Our relationship is difficult to describe, my husband and I are sort of like an Aunt and Uncle to her. We have babysat her little one and taken her to the pedicatrician, we have had birthmom stay here overnight. She has called for advice about the baby and other things. All of my kids call their birthparents by their first names. The grandparents are Grandma and Grandpa and Aunts and Uncles are just that. We did not start out with any openess with our first adoption other than pictures and letters. All relationships have just developed with time. Good luck with your open adoption! Becky  \n",
      "We have three open adoptions with various levels of openess with the birthfmamilies. we have always had a relationship with our middle son's birthgrandparents (paternal) They have been very standoffish and reluctant to be really involved in his life. Our daughter's birthgandpa is great. We just recently met our oldest son's birthgrandma. As an aparent my advice would be to be honest about what you hope will develop. I would state things in general terms so as not to overwhelm them at first. I would let them know how much it means to you to be in your Grandchild's life. Make sure that they know you are aware that they are your Grandchild's parents and that you will respect this. Also, if they have other children, make sure you include them. My daughter's b-grandpa always plays with the boys too and my son's b-grandma always sends hand me downs for both boys and something for our daughter too. As others have said, communication is the key. Open adoption is a wonderful thing, as long as all parties keep in mind that it is for and about the child. Like others here, we have been lucky to develop some friendships along the way as well. Often times at first, everyone is trying not to step on toes and does not know what to expect or what others expect of them. Like any new relationship it takes time. Good luck, what a lucky Grandbaby you have that gets so many people to love her! Becky  \n",
      "How exciting! Good luck to you. We took the ride three times. It was hard to believe that I could love another baby as much as my first, but the love just grows with each addition. Our first adotpion happened fairly quickly and the agency told us the next one would probably take much longer. Well...three weeks after we reapplied our second son came home. We were a bit overwhelmed but knew God had a plan and we just had to roll with the punches. Our daughter was home within two months after we applied the third time! Keep us posted on your progress and again, congratulations! Becky  \n",
      "Hi overwhelmed. I have three kids who were all exposed to some degree to drugs/alcohol during pregnancy. Our oldest is super smart but has some anxiety and behavior issues that I sometimes wonder if they are related to the drug use. If she is willing to do drug tests I would say that is a pretty good sign. Keep in mind that depending on the state you live in, you may have to use an agency. In our state, Colorado, there are essentially no private adoptions. Babies must be placed through licensed agencies. Becky  \n",
      "At the start of my letter writing over seven years ago, I too found it hard to know what to say. As my son, his brother and now their sister have gotten older it has become easier. As they get older and do more and go more places etc. I have more to say. I have always included developmental milestones, likes, dislikes, mannerisms, trips, now acedemics and sports. I recently found out that no one has ever picked up a single letter, and there have been many, over the years. At first, I was devestated for the boys (We have a more open realationship with our daughter's birth mom). Did't we agree on these letters and hundreds of pictures over the years? How could they NOT want to know about these wonderful children? After a few months to mull this over, I have decided that it is most likely very painful for the birthparents at this point to have this information, or that they are in a life situation where for some reason they have been unable to pick the letters up. Anyway, I decided that we made a promise to send letters and pictures and I will continue to do so until each child turns 18. Perhaps at some point they will check to see and will have a chronical of our sons entire lives. If not, then at least my boys know that we honored our promise and that promises like that are not to be broken for any reason. Good luck with those letters! Becky  \n",
      "Liz, we actually live in the Roxborough area in Douglas County, but I grew up in old Littleton not far from the older part of Greenwood Village. Becky  \n",
      "Our oldest son is 7 our middle son is 4 and our daughter just turned one this month. How old are your kids? How many more are you hoping to adopt? I think we are done...but I thought that after our second son and then I started to get this overwhelming feeling that we were supposed to adopt at least once more. :) Becky  \n",
      "Hi everyone. I am a mom to 3 children who were adopted. Recently our youngest daughter's birthaunt announced she is expecting and will place. At first she was really interested in us, but alas it was not to be as the birthdad convinced her to do a totally closed adoption (as he is hiding this pregnancy from his ex-wife and four kids.) Anyway...we really thought we were probably done at three, but....this has got us to thinking about one more. We know we can't afford the agency we have used in the past, although they were good, they were expensive. I have gotten info. from adoption alliance and they look pretty good. I was wondering from Liz especially and others how the foster/adopt system works. We really would love to have a little one younger than, or about the same age as our daugther who will turn 2 in July. Can you specify age/sex etc...when working with foster/adopt? I think we will be attending one of their info. sessions soon, but thought since some of you have been there I would pick your brains. Thanks in advace. PS: Is life at your house settling down a bit Liz? Becky:)  \n",
      "Wow! five months old! time goes by so fast. I am glad things are going so well for you guys. Have you finalized yet or is that coming up here pretty soon? Enjoy that little one! Becky  \n",
      "Thanks that helps alot! I think we could probably handle the foster/adopt situation at thist point. I could not have done it the first time out. Even waiting the 6-8 weeks to have parental rights relinquished was hard. I think we will go to one of their info. sessions! Thanks again! Becky  \n",
      "Hi everyone! Just wanted to let you know that my brother-in-law and his wife had a baby placed with them last week. He was born on the 5th and placed on the 7th. He is so darn cute! We are very excited that our three kids will have a cousin close by who is adopted and of similar ethinic background. He looks a lot like my middle son did as a newborn. We saw him Saturday and I could hardly keep my hands off of him. My husband had to remind me that I was sure three would be enough. Becky  \n",
      "Liz, how exicting for you guys! Wow that was fast. How long do you have the visits before the kids come to live with you? Are they fairly close by right now? Some days I feel so busy with three (even though there was a time when I wanted 6), you will be super busy with that crew! how wonderful for you!!! We are just fine. My brother-in-law from Fort Collins is adopting through Small Miracles like we did and they were matched this week. The potetial birth mom is due November 29th with a baby boy. I am so excited that My kids will have a cousin close by who is adopted and also of similar ethnic background. This baby and my middle son will have very similar ethinic make-up (Hispanic, African American and Caucasion)! I think this will be so good for all of them growing up! Again, so happy for you, fill us all in on more of the deails when you have time! Becky:)  \n",
      "Hi! Welcome. What happens when a baby is born depends on what the birthmom wants. With our first, his birthmom did not choose a family until after his birth and he was in cradle care for six days. We met the birthparents at a restaurant and picked him up later that day. With our second son we were chosen the day before his birth and met her and the baby in the hospital the day after delivery. That hospital was kind of weird, they of course knew what was going on but acted as though we were invisible. With our daughter's birth, we met the birthmom about three weeks before she delivered. While we were not at the delivery, we did talk by phone and went to the hospital several hours after the birth. That hospital was totaly different. The staff was very supportive of the birthmom and her decision and also of us as the babies parents. Of course she made it clear to them that she wanted us included in everything and that we were to be the child's mom and dad. I think it depends a lot on the hospital staff's individual opinions and experiences with adoption. There is still a lot of ignornace out there about adoption, especially open adoption. It makes many folks feel really uncomfortable. I think it is important for you to establish what the birthmom thinks she will want as far as your involvement at the hospital before the birth, but also to realize that she may change her mind when it actually happens. It is also so important to make sure that her needs are getting met after the baby is born and that not all of everyone's attention is on the baby. She may also need more time alone with the baby then she thought she would. This can be really scary for you, but I tried to think of it as a time when she was really trying to make sure that this was the right choice and also that this was one of the few times, (and in our son's case the only time) that she would see her baby, and have time with him/her. Also, I was not prepared the first time for the sadness that I felt. I was overwhelmingly happy to be a mommy at last, but I was pretty naive about how the birtmom's loss would affect me. Anytime such a tremendous gain comes at someone elses tremedous cost, it is not without lots of emotion. I had spent so much time thinking about finally having a family, it was not until it happened that I really, really understood the loss involved for the woman who had to make such a heart wrentching choice. Good luck with your journey, it is a hard one, but so worth it when you have your baby in your arms! Becky  \n",
      "Wow, I know it's frustrating to wait!!!!! We were really lucky once we switched to Small Miracles to be placed so fast each time. We did reccommend them to a couple in Montana who placed within about six months and the distance did not seem to hurt them. We send letters and pictures to the boys birthparents, through the agency, and have a realationship with the paternal grandparents of one of the boys. Interstingly, neither of the boy's birthparents have ever picked up a single letter (and there have been many). I think from reading a lot of posts here from birth parents, I have to conclude that it was just too hard to maintain contact for them emotionally. Our daughter's birthmom is pretty young, just now 18, and we have had ongoing contact with her. 4-6 visits this first year and she and her family were here for the first birthday party last month. Birthmom calls about every 3-6 weeks to check up, sometimes she wants a visit sometimes she does not. I think there are many birthparents who want a semi-open adoption, where there is not personal contact, but where there are ongoing letters and maybe an occasional call. So the distance would probably not hurt you there. I did not know the status had changed to charitable organization. They have always had a pretty small staff, so that does not surprise me too much. Yes, we were told that they work with about 20 or so couples at a time. I know that times have been tough for them, like much of the country and that they have been soliciting donations recently, so this may be why they changed there status. They may have cut staff for the same reason and this may be why things are slower. As for the profiles, we were under the impression that they were only shown to birthparents when they felt strongly that we could be a potential match. The first time we were shown to one woman who later decided to parent, and then to our oldest's birthparents who as I understand it each kept one. The second and third times, we were shown only once and chosen each time. Through the mess with the first agency, where we were never shown in two years, lost money, time and felt so cheated, I was pretty angry and confused. When we finally had our son in our arms and then our second and now our daughter, I could not imagine having had some other child as mine. These were children who were meant to be ours. It is impossible to explain, but someday all the craziness will make sense when you have your family! Becky \n",

      "I am in the DFW area and all I know is Tarrant county is in great demand for infant homes.. for some reason people are taking older children.. you can do age groups 5 and under.. but really once your placement worker calls you you can tell her what ages you prefer,, since you have adopted before they like for you to have your first adopted child be the oldest.. I believe the homestudies are the same.. I get paid $20.00 a day per child in my house but that could vary.. some children are placed with you until they could find relatives.. we just fostered a 4 month old boy that went home after 3 weeks well to grandma anyways.. I absolutely love doing this even if its temporary.. We are adopting two girls who are siblings in July .. My placement worker told me to talk to people to see if their interested because Tarrant County is hurting for homes right now.. any questions feel free to ask.. Amy  \n",
      "we do not have any children so the first set we knew we would adopt.. only because their my best friends neices and they were in foster care.. we now foster babies and toddlers to foster them,, it didnt take us long to get approved to do this.. we took the five week course which is 6 hours every saturday for 5 weeks.. we got out classes done on decemeber 21st.. and we were approved homestudy and all on January 6th.. so it went fast..  \n",
      "Yes it is the case you can use an agency or the CPS offices.. but if for some reason you fall in love with a child if you foster through the state and if for some reason you do adopt.. the state will reimburse you $1500.00 per child.. not sure about agencies as we are with the state.. but i can guarantee you I bet your classes would be in Arlington where mine were.. just call the recruiting office and ask them to send information to you or go to an information meeting... there you will also meet with agencies and the state  \n",
      "you put forth $1500.00 dollars to adopt a child and the state reimburses you... most case workers are easy but what I have noticed is alot of them are overworked and it could be days before you talk again... I got lucky I deal alot with my placement worked and she is excellent.. I could give you a number of someone to call to talk to.. shes my placement worker... email me if you want to talk to her she will direct you in the right direction... like I said tarrant county is hurting for foster parents not foster/adopt... but some do turn to adoption... we're adopting our foster daughters in july and we have room for one more to foster until they find other placement for them.. i sent you a private message too.. with my email  \n",
      "Hello I am in the DFW area too.. you can call 1-800-228-8226 that is the recrutiing office in arlington.. we only have 3 more classes to go but most of your questions can be answered with them... If I am not mistaken i think you have to be married for atleast 2 years but i would calland ask them... I could be wrong though as long as you've been together a while.. they may overlook it... good luck amy  \n",
      "K9 me and my husband start classes on Saturday too in Arlington we are doing the 5 week course also.. We went ahead and set up our CPR, First Aid classes and our TB test with a company that comes out to your house and does this all for $10.00 a peice so it will cost my husband and I $50.00 since I am already CPR trained.. its nice to know there are others where I am at in the process.. Good luck everyone.. I guess I need to get my dog's shots records from our vet.. Amy  \n",
      "Can you tell me what to expect from a homestudy.. how long do they take?? what questions do they ask? can you tell me your experience.. thanks so much in advance Amy  \n",
      "Well we got our approval on the homestudy alone for our kinship foster care. And the judge signed a court order approving to have the the homestudy done a.s.a.p. does this mean that we will get a quick homestudy like a walk through?? the social worker said the children have to be moved by sat the 1st of nov.. so my concern is the social worker wants to move them here to my house and we are both looking for someone to do a speedy homestudy.. she is in another county actually 6 hours from me.. so i have been calling some social workers by my house asking this question.. otherwise the kids go to foster care home until i can get my classes done. but we're doing the homestudy first since there is now a court order for it so we can move the girls this weekend.. anybody have clues as to what a quick and speedy homestudy would entail?? the children's social worker stated that sometimes a social worker can just do a walk through.. what will they look at?? I have 3 dogs will this be a problem?? they are all up to date on shots.. what else will i need to have done??? thanks in advance  \n",
      "Can you actually tell me how detailed the homestudy is?? and how long did it take start to finish? how many days or just one day.. what needs to be childproofed? How much time did they spend looking at the house or did they spend all there time talking to you.. thanks sorry for all questions just curious.. Amy \n",

      "I agree... I know how wonderful it is to get \"The Call\" and for everything to seem perfect. But, I also know the pain of having to turn a month and half plan down because the bm's ideas kept getting more and more one sided. Please pray about this situation and trust your gut instinct. You've waited a long time to be a mother and the child of your dreams will come to you if you put yourselves in God's hands. Good Luck with your decision.  \n",
      "Hi, I know what you mean by wanting to know some of the \"fun\" things about the birthparents. I too wanted to know all of the specifics, the real obvious things and after my nerves clamed down I was able to ask our sons birthmother all sorts of fun things. For example: Favorite color, favorite subject in school, favorite type of music, song, sport, favorite relative and why, all of the places she had traveled to or lived, favorite type of movie and which was her favorite overall, food, personality traits; was she mostly a happy go lucky people pleaser type ,was she a leader or follower. I asked her what her favorite childhood memory was. I asked her about the child she was parenting as well. She was a very open, very giving woman and allowed me to ask all I wanted. That was very good for me. Then I allowed her the same. We were able to gain a mutual respect and confidence in each other. She has not ever contacted us since Kyle's birth in 1999, but she could if she wanted. And, I have loads of information to share with him. Good Luck!  \n",
      "Thanks! I wish I had read this about a year and a half ago. We were quickly matched with a birthmother in November, she was due Dec. 27. She had 7 other children which she had lost custody of in one way or another. She claimed to have lost respect for the attorney ahe was working through, but found talking to me comforting. She lost her money order she had bought with her December living expense money (supplied to the attorney by us) and asked for more money a couple of days before Christmas. She then kept me on the phone long distance for hours at a time. One minute she thought we were great and the next she didn't know if she could go through with her adoption plan. There were more red flags, but I kept right on counseling her and trying to make it work. On December 26 she called to say she was going to the hospital on the 27 to be induced or for a C-section. I tied to get the name of the hospital and she said she really didn't know between two area ones which she would end up go to. She asked for me to wire her the January money and to make travel plans. I got really excited thinking it was going to work, but something told me not to wire the money. She called the next morning asking for the money and I said I was just going to bring it to the attorney since we were coming anyway. She got very angry that I had talked with the attorney and said she needed to think and hung up. She called back later and said she changed her mind. We were on such a rollercoaster. Well, I say we, but she only wanted to talk to me. I am trying not to make these mistakes again.  \n",
      "Hi, This is my first posting. I am trying to keep myself busy by doing anything and everything related to adoption. My husband and I are waiting for for second placement. We live in South Carolina, but are working through a CA attorney. We have been waiting for our second child since a failed adoption 2 days after Christmas in 2001. It took 8 months before we were matched with another birthmother, but it also failed in August of 02. This was a terribly painful failure due to our 3 year old being with us in CA. He was very excited about bring his brother home to his house. Kyle is a very loving, sweet, and sensitive child. Oh, he is all boy, but he is very sensitive too! The child we went to CA to adopt was taken from our Hotel room in the middle of the night by a Sherrif's Deputy. This all happened due to a claim the birthmother's mom made as to the mental capacity of the birthmother. All claims were found to be untrue, but the family as a whole made many threats and we, after much prayer in a 36 hour period, thought it best for us and our child not to proceed with this adoption. Now, we are back in the waiting game with anxious hearts. We know by our faith in God that our child will come to us when God's perfect timing is in place. That doesn't mean it will an easy wait. My concern is this... Knowing how heartbroken Kyle was when we did not bring home a baby in August and the trauma he endured as a result, is it wrong for me to feel we should not take him with us the next time? Should we even tell him? I'm very torn about this. I've never lied to him and I would not ever do anything to make him feel betrayed. I wanted him to be a big part of the new baby's arrival. We also need some feedback on Hispanic/ Caucasian adoptions. Kyle in 1/2 Spanish and 1/2 Caucasian. Both of our failed adoptions have been the same. We are starting to realize that the Hispanic culture would prefer the child remain within their culture at any cost. We have requested our attorney to search for another H/C child so Kyle would feel their was no difference. Does anyone have good resourses for this type of adoption. I have visited my Doc and let him know we are interested in adoption as he refers birthmothers to an area attorney from time to time. We are jsut telling everyone we know and aking for prayer as well. Please respond  \n",
      "Thanks to all who have responded so far! I've jsut been feeling so horrible about my own feelings of not telling Kyle anything when the next one comes along. Thank you for your reassurances. He is a very observant little boy and can really tune in to our behavior, so it's hard for us to talk to each other or to friends about the subject. Also, we have two nephews born to our family (1 day apart) in December. Kyle was concerned about which one would be coming home to live with us. That was a tough one to explain too! And now, our best couple friends, who happen to have his best girl friend just found out they are pregnant! It seems I am constantly explaining to him that these children are not ours; that God has another very special birthmother for us who will ask us to love, cherish and raise the child she is carrying. But, he thinks about it all the time. When we are shopping and I buy him something he always asks me to buy one for his baby. He can really bring tears to my eyes on some days. Again, thank you all!  \n",
      "Hi everyone, Thanks for the new responses. We have a birthmother again!!! We talked with her on Thursday night and had a good conversation. She has had a very hard life and really seems to want to do the very best thing for her unborn child. But, we find ourselves approaching this very cautiously. We have not yet told Kyle about our new adoption plan and have decided not to tell him until a couple of weeks from now. The baby is due in May. We just need time to feel better ourselves before we tell him. We are not taking him with us this time. We are trying to decide how to tell him we are going to be away for about a week without him. We've never been away from him for more than 1 night. I liked the idea of telling him were are visiting a friends baby, but he is too smart for that. He'll ask a hundred questions and I truly feel honesty is best between a parent and a child. He will be four in April and is very observant and intuiative. I'm amazed every day. I can't even talk on the phone without him figuring out who I'm talking to and what we're talking about.:) I truly want him with us because he deserves to be included, but my fear is that he will get hurt again. This birthmother knows what we went through in August and was very sweet to tell us we would not have to worry about her changing her mind. She doesn't even want living expenses! So I do feel she is committed to her adoption plan. What do you guys think? Help.... Kim  \n",
      "Hi Linny, Thank you for your honesty. I needed that! I am guilty of allowing Kyle to do more than a three year old probably should, not harmful things. He tries to read, he spells easy words, when in the car he tries to read the billboards by sounding out the words, so I get caught up in all of that and I guess a little proud too. But, it no excuse to allow adult decisions to be on his sweet little mind. I mean, even though he is bright he does still think he is Buzz Lightyear too! To me he is exceptional. His birthmother was extreamly bright. I guess he takes after her alot. Anyway, thank you for reminding me that he is still a lttle guy. I talked with our birthmother this afternoon and she sounded good. She said she was getting anxious that I wasn't going to call back. I take that as a good sign. I'm not getting too excited yet either because I know all too well that things can go wrong. See, this birthmother has confided in us that she has used drugs and alcohol during this and her first four pregnacy's. All four of her first children are fine. I know that doesn't mean this child will be and that is something dh and I are dealing with. When we talked on Thursday night I didn;t think I could follow through, but after prayer and talking to our pediatrician, insurance co., and a detox center, I had the BIG PICTURE, and I'm beginning to feel more comfortable. I know this child may be born with birth defects or may have learning dissabilities. But, as I have been praying a real peace has come over me. I feel that if this is the child God has planned for our family that he has been protecting the baby all along. I know that sounds terribly romantic, but I believe God can do anything. We have plans to enter the birthmother into a Drug/Maternity home for the remaining 6 weeks. She really wants to do it. After she is admitted she will be tested thouroughly. At this point I'm not sure if the results will change our minds in any way. In my heart, I already have a child. Of course we pray he/she is healthy. Now, the selfish side of me really wants the baby to be as perfect as Kyle, but hey, my brother is infintly smarter than I am and our parents loved us both equally. I know everything will be fine whatever the results say. Please keep this birthmother and baby in your prayers. I will update you all as the results come in. Kim  \n",
      "First of all, congratulations on being able to talk about preparing to make an adoption plan among co-workers and friends. It really helps to be able to do that, but I know what you're going through. My husband and I have had two failed adoptions in the past 15 months through an attorney in CA. We have specified a Caucasian/Hispanic child because we have a 3 year old of the same ethnic background. We are Caucasian. Anyway, our experience with the Hispanic culture has been that of solidarity of family. We hold no ill feelings for them or their culture. We completely embrace it!!! Our child is learning Spanish and we have many Hispanic friends. Oops, off on the wrong track! Anyway, in the past three months we have been approached by a former co-worker and my present employer who say they each have situations for us. I've tried not to be pushy as well. But, each time I see them I just want to say.. Hey, remember me, the one you dangled a child in front of? I know that sounds ugly, but I guess in their defense, everyone just wants to help. They all want to see us with another child. But, that doesn't stop the mental gymnastics my mind does at all hours of the day wondering if either will work out. All I can offer as advice is to not let it slip through your hands. If you feel your friend is the best link to this bm then give her a copy of your portfolio. If you have selected an attorney to finalize your adoption send word to the bm that if she has questions she could talk to the appointed attorney. Just keep the fire burning until there isn't a reason to do so. Good Luck to you!  \n",
      "leannh, Sorry I haven't been able to get online until now. But, to answer your question we are in South Carolina. We used an attorney in the Temecula area. He was wonderful during our first adoption (of course you tend to be on cloud nine and think everyone is wonderful when all goes well) and that is why we signed on with him again. Also, there isn't as much likely hood of us adopting a Hispanic/Caucasian baby in SC. We actually found him through a faciliatator in Los Gatos. We matched through her in March of 99 with a bm in the Fresno area, but it didn't work beyond the face to face meeting with her. So, after a couple of weeks of healing we called the attorney and he started showing our portfolia. We got that wonderful call on April 11, 1999. Our son was born on the 24th. Now we are just waiting for another God sent birthmother. Kim  \n",
      "Blue Star, Hi, Please know you are not alone. My husband and I statred the adoption process due to my infertility(emergency complete hysterectomy at age 23) in March of 1998. We were Homestudy approved in November of 1998. We matched with a California birthmother (through a facilitator) in March of 1999. It failed! But, we loved her attorney and began the journey to our family with him the next week. We received a phone call on Sunday night April 11, 1999 with the news we had waited for; we were matched with another birthmother who was due in 3 days. We never hesitated. We welcomed our beautiful little Michael Kyle on April 24. You are doing all you can do at this point. Prayer, Prayer and Prayer. God will amaze you with his love for you and your husband. His love will come in the form of the most beautiful child you have ever seen. Your life will never be the same, it will be so much fuller. Just hang in there. Spend some time with an adoptive support group in your area. Believe me, it makes the wait seem better. I will keep you in my prayers and I hope you will return the favor. We have had two failed adoptions since December 2001. The most recent being in August 2002. Each have been painful, but August much more because we allowed our 3 year old to go to CA with us to get another son. The birtmothers family stepped in and stopped the process. We have jealed and are back to waiting for our child. The one God has for us. Sincerely, Carolina Mommy  \n",
      "Dear Hopeful... My heart breaks for you both. I now how you feel times two and it doesn't make it easier. God hears our prayers and I will be adding you to my prayer tonight. Please believe me that when the God Planned baby comes along you will know it and the feeling will be more wonderful than you could ever imagine. That is what has kept us going. We adopted in 1999, a boy. The since 2001 we've had two failed and now have another birthmother. So, we'll see how this one goes. Just remember tha adoption is ablout finding a family for a baby, not the opposite. You two will soon look back on this failure and say, so this is why we had to endure pain and heartache. Good luck!

      "Congratulations Amber on your baby girl! Please know that you are not alone. Adoption doesn't \"cure\" issues regarding infertility. And truly, I think it is incredibly difficult to truly resolve those feelings. You get more to a place where it becomes more of a passing thought. My DH and I worked for 19 years to build our family. We have one daughter conceived with the help of IF treatment and one son made ours through adoption. Both are miracles to me. Have I accepted that treatment is behind us? Yes Have I accepted that another pregnancy is not going to happen? Yes But that doesn't mean I don't cringe when I hear someone complaining about their pregnancy or thinking that everyone under the son wants FB updates. Is there a small piece of jealousy that exists for what seems to have come so easy to others, but not for us? Yes. There is nothing wrong with trying treatment again if that works for your family. I know someone who tried it after adoption because they finally had insurance coverage for it. It's what worked for them at that time.Good luck with your decision and know you are certainly not alone!  \n",
      "I guess my question about emoms and medicaid would be: what would they do to pay their bill if they chose to parent? Emoms can't become bmoms until they tpr and that can't happen until after birth so what was the \"plan\"? The PAP's did not force her to become pregnant - it's not a surrogacy contract. I think that if an emom is eligible for medicaid and cannot afford her own medical or have private insurance than she has a responsibility to herself to apply for medicaid. A couple who plans on parenting their baby, but the baby dies during childbirth is still responsible for their hospital bill. No one says, sorry you're not going home with a baby so you get a pass. The emom is her own person with her own medical situation, yes it involves the baby, but again until she signs tpr, what is her plan to take care of her financial responsibilities? I know my opinion won't be popular, but again, emoms shouldn't feel coerced. I can only imagine how coerced a person would feel if someone picked up their hospital bill. Medicaid exists for people who meet the criteria - they should use it if they need it. PAPs don't have money trees in their backyards - many have to take loans just to afford to adopt. My last point thought is this: every dollar I have to give an emom for her personal expenses, bills, medical, etc... is one less dollar I have for our new child, for their education, care, needs, etc.... We are more than happy to assume the responsibilities for our child (at tpr, they become our child), but I'm not adopting the emom. Again, I know my opinion won't be popular. I'm not trying to insult bmoms, but I don't feel like PAPs should have to shoulder all the responsibility for a situation that they are a 3rd party to. I do apologize in advance if anyone feels slighted or insulted by my view - it's not my intent at all, just another viewpoint.  \n",
      "Judi,There was one organization that we applied to, but I can't find the info now, but I recall it was called Show Hope Foundation. They are need based and at the time you had to be homestudied, but not yet matched. You could use any award toward any type of adoption; domestic, international, special needs, etc.... showhope.orgGood luck!  \n",

      "I'm sorry but I feel I must chime in here. I respectfully do not agree with some of the opinions about this case. If there was any part to be considered kidnapping it was done by the original babysitter when she left Nebraska for Tennessee. There was a point when the Hodgins were legal foster parents and DCS was fully involved. This was a DCS screw up. I feel this is where the blame should lay. But with all the nasty things being said about the Hodgins family and their motivations I have 1 question- as parents we are supposed to love our children unequivocally and without fail - are we not to do everything we can to keep them safe, love them no matter what? I feel that is what they are trying to do- love doesn't stop just because a court decided a ruling should be overturned. I think they truly believe Sonia is not in a good or safe home and are terrified for her. Perhaps rather than disregard their feelings of hurt, loss, and fear we could try to imagine what exactly we'd really do if we had parented a child for nearly 8 years then be told you don't matter. QUOTE=wrking21]Sorry Millie - The story was so convoluted I thought they were foster parents to the child. Lord must have lost track at some point.... sounds like another legal kidnapping to me![/QUOTE]  \n",
      "Me, me, me! I have to chime in here. I am not adopted, but I was the youngest in my family so my parents were older. I vividly remember starting when I was about 8 or 9 having those fears about either of them dying, but especially my mom as she was the \"rock\" of the family. I can remember lying in bed sobbing at night just thinking about it and yes, always working the math and computing her age with my at different life points. Why? I have no idea really other than realizing that people do die. What helped me move past the \"crisis\" - pretty much time and my mom finding me sobbing one night and a long conversation about what you already said about being healthy, but also my parents plan for us kids should anything happen to them. She shared that my aunt and uncle who I dearly love would be our guardians, but also other relatives who would be there to support and love us too. Knowing there was a plan in place helped. When my oldest voiced similar fears (she is our bio btw) I shared our plan for her as well as pointing out family longevity and my own good health. That seemed to help too. She also was around 8/9 at the time. It will be interesting to see what happens with my son - he's only 2 now, but when he is 7/8/9, we will be late 40s/early 50s. FWIW, when my daughter went through it, I was around early to mid-30s.  \n",
      "Could this be the alpha feta protein (AFP) screening that they offer to screen for neural tube defects? It's been a loooooonnnnngggg time since I had my oldest, but I do remember the screening and it was right about that time frame along in the pregnancy. I remember that a level 2 u/s which is a more magnified u/s than found in the dr's office would have been the next step to look more closely at the spine and brain. I remember my dr saying that the AFP has a high rate of re-screens.  \n",
      "Perhaps it's the wording she is using, but this feels like it is a HUGE red flag to me. She would be able to have some type of expense money and it would be up to her to decide how to use it - be it towards rent, food, childcare costs. It is not your responsibility to provide her with childcare. It is also not your responsibility to arrange her childcare for her. I would ask your attorney for his advice and wording on any message or email reply to her to make sure you are doing everything legally.  \n",
      "wrking, our adoption looks very different from yours, so I have no advice per se, but kudos for being so thoughtful. I will say that you should not have to feel bad for wanting to enjoy your child's first birthday. The day is her day and takes precedence over the birthmother's feelings. If the birthmom is still grieving so hard, then that's another reason to not invite her, why make it tough on her and also run the risk of her emotions spoiling your child's day?  \n",
      "Sent a PM as well.  \n",
      "Questioning, I can only imagine how stressful this situation must be. I am concerned that she is acting in a verbally abusive way to the agency, but positive with you. I'm wondering what she is asking of them that seems to be setting her off? Our birthmom has done that with the agency and it was usually an attempt to get more money or she was using. I wish you the best of luck with this situation.  \n",
      "She is probably more nervous than you are. Good luck, hope it goes well!  \n",
      "Ladies, what am I missing? I know I don't check in as frequently, but is there a board that is \"hot\" right now?  \n",
      "Just found out last night that E's birthmom is pregnant again. Some of you may remember that we were contacted last spring by our agency as bmom was pregnant and wanted to place. She was early in the pregnancy, but wanted all the living expense money like yesterday. After looking at our financial picture, we had to declined and they matched her with another family. I knew from the FB grapvine that she either lost that pregnancy or had an abortion sometime in the summer - from some posts I strongly suspect abortion, but don't know for sure. (Found that out in the fall). So we were really glad that we hadn't matched as we couldn't afford to lose that money. She just posted last night the ultrasound for her newest pregnancy and is over the moon happy. Last spring's relationship ended and now she's \"really in love this time\". Her plan is to parent and for the baby's sake, I hope she's clean and ready. Frankly, I am angry - angry because I learned that her oldest is sitting in a foster home, legally free, but has many issues that made adoption unlikely. He has RAD behavior and it's recommended that he be an only or the oldest and no pets. She recently made some comments about this child as if he were some lost toy. No real remorse for what her abuse and neglect caused. I know addicts rarely take full responsibility. But I am angry - angry for my E and the effects her drug use has had. Angry for his 1/2 brother who is wounded and has no permanency. Angry for E's 1/2 sisters who she doesn't even mention. Last night I just hugged E tighter and thanked God that he never had to ride the rollercoaster of DFS & foster care.  \n",
      "If I could triple \"like\" what dmarie just said I would! You phrased it exactly what I was feeling, but couldn't figure out how to explain. The thing is, my son's story is his. He's too young to express (and comprehend) it right now, so I would rather err on the side of caution and guard his and our family's privacy. FWIW, those who have been told of his adoption almost all have asked details about his birth family. To answer those questions would just take on a \"gossipy\" effect. Again it just makes my son a \"curiosity.\"  \n",
      "Caliguy we were in a similar situation this spring when our son's bmother asked to adopt the baby she was expecting. We looked at everything from our finances and factoring in additional childcare to the extra money we would need for adoption fees. We also considered where our son was at developmentally and if we simply could handle it. We ultimately declined to match with her for his sibling. Part of me felt very badly about it, but the other part of me had to remind myself that I am not responsible for her choices and am not her private social service safety net. If I was parenting all of her children right now I would have a 7, 5,4, & newborn in addition to our 20 month old son whom she placed with us. She is parenting none of her children. Some by choice, some by state's choice. While it's incredibly sad for them that they are not all together, there is a LOT in their stories that's incredibly sad.I guess my point to you is, only you can determine what you can handle and what you want to handle. It's okay to say no if that's what feels right for you and your family.  \n",
      ":mad: I just need a safe \"anonymous\" place to vent. While I have read and listened to all the advice from this board regarding privacy and sharing your child's adoption story, never until this evening did I realize how many people overshare about stuff in their lives and other peoples whether it's about adoption or not. An extended family member has been battling an illness and was just finally diagnosed with cancer. Horrible enough for sure. One of their children is adopted. Someone who knows this person just put on a FB group that I am also a member of (didn't know until today that we were both on it, large group) everything about the family from the illness and diagnosis to facts about their children including the adopted child's \"story\" and foster care history. All in an attempt to solicit donations (which the family themselves isn't asking for!). I wanted to throw up. I am horrified beyond words for that child and royally ticked!  \n",
      "Thanks everyone. I did private message her and kindly pointed out the privacy issue. I got a somewhat snarky and defensive reply back, but it appears the post was taken off. The group has over 1200 members and the post was up for over 12 hours so...yeah...not real happy. In the past when you knew a family in need, you called them or a close relative and asked if you could bring a meal, or come and do laundry, or run errands for them, babysit, etc...now I'm seeing more and more people take to FB and make one big gossip-y post encouraging people to send money, gift cards, etc... Jeesh!  \n",
      "We got a line of credit from PNC - we were not customers at the time - and it was not high interest. You could always use your credit card if you have one for the short term as well. If the lawyer doesn't take credit cards, you could use one of those checks that they send out. Good luck!  \n",
      "So I've been reading some other boards and FB pages on adoption and I'd just like to get some opinions on our situation. Each adoption story is unique so I know that there is no perfectly right answer, but....at what age would it be appropriate to share with my son that he was born drug addicted? That issue was a major reason why he was placed for adoption. I want to be honest and truthful if asked \"Why was I placed for adoption?\" but don't think that info is appropriate for a young child. I don't want him to feel ashamed or embarrassed about it - it was done to him, but he does need to understand eventually that it is important to his health. When his is very young, we will keep it short, but want to add to his history as he grows.  \n",
      "Thanks DryWall & Oak for the suggestions. Both are very helpful and I really like the idea of saying that his bmom could not give him a safe home for the early years. We can add in more as his understanding and maturity grows. My heart already hurts thinking about some of these conversations because it's so personal, but how can anyone understand that for a drug user the idea that they are hurting their baby while they are pregnant & using is very abstract.  \n",
      "Just curious if anyone has read this book or been to one of his lectures? A friend just recommended it and I hope to pick up a copy soon.  \n",
      "This was a very interesting read. It took me 4 sittings though which is why it's taken me so long to comment. I kept getting interrupted and would lose my place!I do think it showed an overwhelming consensus from all sides of the triad that there is way too much marketing going on in adoption, especially online. I think there was also a consensus that OBC's need to be available to everyone regardless of birth year. I am glad I got E's for him.  \n",
      "Good luck MeInIL! I swear by Cold-eez which are zinc lozenges.  \n",
      "All, congratulations! I would agree with your DH given your previous losses. I would be as sensitive in the email wording as you can, but just as we cannot dictate to birth families what they do and how they live after they place, they can't dictate to us the same. I may get flamed for saying this, but it's kinda selfish of the extended bfamily to want and expect her to be an only child. That's unfair to her and to you! Good luck!  \n",
      "Sounds like a pretty typical toddler. E is 18 months and we've had some of the hitting/roughness and toy throwing too. I hate that daycare is labeling him as \"bullying\" because truly, they are too young to bully which I think is a conscious decision to seek out another to pick on. He may just really want to communicate with the other child or be frustrated at something that's happening. I've had several of those moments of \"is this typical toddler or drug exposure\" because this is my first time parenting a boy - my daughter was less curious, didn't like to roughhouse, and for lack of a better phrase was more what you might expect from a girl. When I need a bit of a \"boy check\", I go to BabyCenter and check out his birth club forum and read up on what other moms are going through. So far I've been reassured every time! :-)  \n",
      "Melissa,I'm going with a maybe and a yes. While other PP have indicated that she may or may and might be just an intense baby anyway, drug exposure can exacerbate an intense personality. Another thing to consider is that she has been multi-drug exposed.A good friend of ours adopted a baby who was supposed to have no exposure, but they later learned that she was and again it was a multi drug mix. This little one has sensory issues and is already receiving therapy to help with it. Her biggest trigger is laying flat - she has an issue with sensations relating to her inner ear. The car seat was a disaster for her as well as crib/bassinet. She would scream herself to exhaustion. I'm not telling you this to frighten you or worry you, but you may want to speak with her ped and even consider contacting Help Me Grow. If she does have a sensory issue, getting help early will help her immensely. If it's just her personality, then at least you know. I found out that drug exposed babies who are in FC in our area automatically get Help Me Grow visits, but those who are placed in an adoptive home don't. My little guy was opiate exposed, is extremely strong, had the stiff limbs at birth, and tremors. He shows some sensory here and there and I will discuss it with his ped at his next visit. Good luck!  \n",
      "Cyber hugs for you today. I think many of us get it. No one offered us a shower or would even ask how things were going while we were waiting. I know some people were afraid to because there are only so many ways to say \"nothing new yet.\" Even when our little guy came home, it was weird - those that I thought would want to come and visit right away didn't and those that I didn't think would, were there immediately BUT the best and most meaningful moment was at our finalization where so many family members took the day from work to come and show their support - even our judge remarked at how amazing and happy that way to see. Hang in there, your day will come. It will be different and your experiences will be different from hers, but they will be wonderful, special, and all yours! :-)  \n",
      "Sounds like it, but how did he find her? While it does sound like BSE and black market, I would still want a DNA test just to make sure he found the right person. If they did this to her, you can be sure that hospital did that to others! Horrifying!  \n",
      "Hi Kristin,I live in Ohio and we finalized in Ohio - please pm if you have any questions. Allwhohope is correct - you will absolutely need an attorney to finalize. You should also expect a homestudy and quite possibly that you will need to pay for an attorney to represent the bparents as well at their signings. The bdad does have to terminate his rights and if he is MIA then Ohio has a procedure for that - it usually takes about 30 days to get a court order to terminate an absent father's rights and will require advertising in the paper if he is unable to be notified due to unknown address. The bmom can sign temporary custody to you while all this is pending I believe (and while you complete your homestudy). If she already has a case pending against her by CPS, that may complicate things. Good luck! Also, as you and your fiance haven't yet married, I believe that only one of you can legally finalize the adoption then your fiance can adopt after you marry. Hope that makes sense.  \n",
      "I think a \"Social Services Fee\" is a great idea. I did want to clarify about the comment I made about paying back expenses. I do understand that it would seem like coercion to request payback. Some states allow way too much in expenses imo. I do understand someone needing help when they are pregnant and perhaps cannot work. What I don't understand are people who take it just because they can. I know for every dishonest person out there there are many more honest people. I don't want to \"buy\" someone's baby - that's not my intent and that's part of why I don't like the idea of paying expenses. I do think expenses need to be for the basic necessities. Food, shelter, clothing, transportation,water, electric/gas/phone, and medical. I would rather pay into a social service fee pool and know that someone is getting the help they need rather than the way our agency handles it now - the request can be for anything up to the limit allowed by our state. We did see close friends of our get scammed (there were many red flags that their agency downplayed) so that is why I'm very leary about birthparent expenses. Sorry if I sounded too judgemental!  \n",
      "I would contact the hospital's legal department and express your concern for their disregard of your child's adoption. I don't know what type of letters your are tying to obtain, but perhaps their legal department needs to chat with the SW to remind them that adoption is a legal proceeding that names a person as parent to a child. As for retribution on their part, I would remind them that to discriminate against adoptive families could place them at risk for legal action.  \n",
      "My best advice to get started is to contact several agencies both local and national and ask questions, get their info packet, find out about fees and what their average $ range is, their average wait time and anything else that you wish to know. Consider if using a local agency is important to you or if you have the budget to go out of state. Also consider if you are looking at an open adoption or semi-option and if birth family visits are a possibility for you - if you go national you are more likely to have to travel for visits as well as to have to go through ICPC at placement if the baby is born outside of your state. That being said, adoption is NOT easy. I wouldn't call it fun either. Some parts are downright hard, frustrating, and sad. In the end though, my son made it all worth it. There really is no shortcut so be wary of agencies who promise placements super quick. No one can guarantee anything like that. Also ask about their policy for failed matches - do you lose money and how much.  \n",
      "I can't fathom how you would ever have an honest conversation about adoption with her. Someday she will be old enough to use the internet, read her story, have contact with her bio family..... what could they possibly say to justify what she has been through and will go through? Just because you can tie a case up in court for years, doesn't mean you should. I can't imagine how they felt having to lose her after 2 years, but I can't imagine what this will do to her either.... no winners, just sad.  \n",
      "BirdieBeeI am not a fan of open adoption at all. With that being said, is it written you must see them at all? Maybe two pictures and one visit a year would suffice. If that doesn't go well, no visits and one picture a year. Birdie, please don't feel I'm picking, because feelings about OA are different for everyone and no one way is right for everyone, but it's important to look at what was *promised* not just if it's written or not. In adoption, our word needs to matter - it's all we have to stand on. If monthly visits were promised, then it needs to be a VERY good reason to change that. A PP had a wonderful suggestion for wording a conversation starter - something along the lines of \"I feel like our visits could be so much more if we...\" I think it's important to have that conversation and commit to working things out rather than just changing things without consideration for the BPs feelings. I also can't imagine only sending 1 photo 1x a year. If that was something that was agreed upon by all, that's one thing, but at the least, couldn't a stack of photos that span the years events be included? It just feels very harsh to suggest going from visits every month to 1 picture and no visits a year. One suggestion for the OP (please update us!), if visits every month are too stifling, and you've had that convo with the bps, what about suggesting to them visits every other month with a pic/letter update on the \"off\" month? But honestly, we know very little about why the OP wants to reduce visits and unless something very wrong is happening during the visits, if you gave your word to that situation, you should think very long and hard before you change that because by doing so, you hurt people, but also damage your integrity.  \n",
      "WMR said check was sent on 4/5 - received refund in the mail today!!! Happy dancing!  \n",
      "Just my .02 - my understanding was that direct advertising would be running an actual ad (like what I've seen in USA Today) and paying for things like a billboard (can't imagine doing that one - but have seen it elsewhere). The agency we worked with made our profile available online on their website. My understanding was that we could contact other sources if we wished such as adoption attorneys, other agencies, doctors, pastors, etc... that was considered networking if we shared our profile with them in case they wanted to share it with someone they knew.  \n",
      "I guess I don't look at the situation from the perspective of each side should have equal ability (i.e. computer access, knowledge of internet search, etc) in order for it to be fair. Some info is plainly public record - such as arrest records, marriage license, divorce info, etc... I'm pretty good at research and know how to find things like court records and such for free. In this way, I have been able to get names of E's birth extended birth family should he ever wish to search and connect with them. While I also understand that many emoms & bmoms are in crisis, its been my experience in our journey both with our failed match and E's adoption that both young ladies were not truthful about some key things. While the agency does handle the paperwork and verification of pregnancy, etc... they pretty much take the emothers at their word for social medical history. Also, at our finalization, our judge asked us if we wanted to proceed with finalization that day or if we wanted more time to investigate the birthfamily and their medical history. Of course we wanted to finalize, but here was a judge basically telling us we could. First time I had heard that!While I would love to be able to blindly trust E's bmom, there have been way too many fibs from here to do so without fact checking her.  \n",
      "So we found out a month ago that E's birthmom is pregnant again. It makes me heartsick for her because again she is in a bad situation. We've been approached about adopting E's half-sibling and are trying to decide if we will agree to the match. Assuming all info is accurate (dates and such) the new baby is due at the end of November/beginning of December. E would only be about 19 months old. It seems impossible to fathom that we could be blessed twice and that we could have 2 babies so close in age. For those who have BTDT, what is it like to have a newborn and a toddler under 2? Some days with E are \"off the tracks\" right now with lots of frustration and tantrums (on his part ;-) mostly due to communication and not liking hearing the world \"no\" (as in no you can't sit on the cat) which sends him into tears. Most other days are sunshine and smiles. I know that's life with a toddler - I just can't grasp what it would look like with and infant! How does one decide? I wish we had more time to decide, but E's bmom wants to match NOW!:eek:  \n",
      "Thank you everyone for your thoughts and experiences. DH and I did an extensive budget factoring in extra childcare costs, diapers, and formula as well as the new fees for the adoption. I am sick to my stomach to admit that we simply can't afford it. But when I look at E I keep thinking, how can we not. My DH is on commission and I used his medium scale in our figures rather than his lowest which does happen at least a few times a year which means that we would need to dip into savings to cover bills, but that would take a huge toll on savings that already are not great. We also looked at a budget with me no working and staying home thus avoiding childcare, but then his income would have to support everything which again doesn't work as my income covers all groceries, gas, and consumables. I keep praying for a way to be shown - we don't have much time to decide, but at least the agency would require that they new family stay in touch with us so the kids could know each other. It's not what I had hoped for, but it's something. The timing is just bad right now, 1 year back or forward and we would have been okay to do it.  \n",
      "Ruth I completely get it and too feel bummed. E's bmom has moved multiple times in the past year and I picture our updates thrown away in the trash. It's not even the letters that bug me, but the thought of E's picture being discarded that makes me feel sick. I did get to speak to her when he was 8 months old and got the distinct impression that she did not know where some of the updates ended up. Her moves were often sudden \"they threw me out\" situations. Sadly I heard recently that she's pregnant again and her first question to the social worker was how fast she could get living expenses. This was right around E's birthday and she never even asked about him. I tell myself that she just has to move on to survive and that's why E is with us and not her.My DH doesn't even understand about the updates. He doesn't get why I spend so much time trying to get a lot of good pics and write a decent letter.I will keep sending the updates because I gave my word, but I know some day E will want to know why or if she ever writes back and it will be hard to tell him no.  \n",
      "Like other PPs have said I would let the one question slide and hope that maybe she was just seeking some reassurance for her decision. Like your DH I find the \"egg donor\" explanation very annoying - it feels like she just put your dd at arms length and also hid part of her story. I honestly think that if she is unable to be honest with her family as your dd approaches puberty, you may want to either set a limit on the visits (no siblings or other family not \"in the know\") or just no in person visits (skype maybe) because puberty is hard and if your dd even gets the slightest sense that her bio parents are \"hiding\" her then she may internalize feelings of shame, rejection, etc... and that is just not fair to her. Good luck! I really don't envy the situation!  \n",
      "I am so sorry for your dear friend. It is the dark side of pre-birth matching. If you can go see you friend -do. Be there for her, but don't try to \"cheer her up.\" Hold her as she cries, cry with her, tell her you love her, and tell her that somehow things will be okay someday. Because they will. Many of us have lived through failed matches and were hurt, crushed, devastated and go on and are okay. We were lucky - we eventually were able to adopt. This is all new and raw for your friend and she needs to be able to grieve. Watching someone in pain is hard, but the greatest gift you can give them is to be there for them. Good luck! Possibly encourage her to come on here when she feels ready - it's a great support.  \n",

I have had those moments many times - especially after teething screaming nights with only 2 hours of sleep (non-consecutive hours at that).

      "ladybug,I'm wondering if moving towards a formal adoption situation is something that you could do now? Your daughter may feel very nervous about her \"permanence\" in your family if there is that possibility that E can revoke the guardianship and decide to parent kwim? It does sound like you have a case for abandonment. The fact that there has been no formal adoption may add to some feelings of abandonment or anger for your daughter. Not knowing your family personally, it was just something that crossed my mind. I do think it sucks (sorry for the plain language there - and no judgement intended towards you) that E has left her hanging all these years - either she wants to parent or not, but 8 years is enough time to know for sure and to make a permanent plan for her child.  \n",
      "bclay,I feel for your situation. Every adoption is uncharted territory with no great \"map\" to follow. A lot of times we proceed with trial and error in the relationship building. I see some similarities in our experiences so I'll just share what I did. Within days of coming home from the hospital, we were getting a high volume of calls and texts. At first I felt a sense of obligation to respond or answer immediately if possible because I wanted to reassure our bmom that all was okay and if she was having a hard time, help her feel better if possible. What I realized after two weeks of this, was that I was becoming more anxious and allowing the contact we had agreed upon to be breached, but I didn't want to damage the relationship or hurt or dishonor anyone. For texts, I began to slow my response time by explaining that I had stopped keeping my phone in my pocket and would only check it when I had time. I was always kind in my responses, but let more time go between answers. When there were requests for texted pics (and they did feel like demands when they were worded as \"Hey, send a text pic now plz.\") I would answer that I wasn't able to right then, but would be sending the update packet by \"x\" date and had some great pics to share. I would text a pic or 2 each week. The calls, some I'd answer, some I'd let go to voicemail if I honestly was not up to a conversation or was just busy with baby. I have noticed that contact seems to ramp up then fall off in cycles. We recently went through a ramped up cycle and it's hard because I don't want to lose the relationship, but do need to feel like our time and privacy is respected as well.Have you finalized yet? That seemed to be a ramp up trigger in our situation. As 1st bday approaches, I expect another.As for the Skype requests, you could simply say that you would rather keep things as they are now as you work on the relationship. Or unless you skype with other people regularly, deactivate your account and say that you simply have cut out the expense of skype.As for Facebook, I would advise considering deactivating your accounts - tell them you need a FB vacation. FB is notorious for boundary crossing in all social venues - not just adoption. Try not to burn any bridges, just shore up your position. Please know I'm not judging when I say this, but you are going to have to let bfamily comments about \"our girl\" roll off your back. To them, she is. Our bmom refers to my son by his middle name which she chose as his 1st name and while it always make me do that \"what? who?\" double take for a second, I realize that that is who he is to her. I have accept that that is not something I can or should try to control. Just try to envision the relationship you would like for the future and how you can get there with respect, honestly, and showing care for all. Good luck because I do understand how hard it can be.  \n",
      "Congrats on hearing something so quickly! Wow! and yes, your feelings are normal. There were situations that we declined to be shown for because of various reasons - financial needs went beyond our budget, baby had genetic issue that was more than we could handle medically, and even the openness being requested for multiple family members in several cities (going beyond our comfort level) and yes, I always felt guilty, but I reminded myself that I couldn't be everything to everyone - I had to be the best mom to my potential child and if I didn't feel I could then it wasn't fair to him/her or their birthfamily. It does get easier. Good luck!  \n",
      "I love all of these ideas, but honestly right now after running up and down stairs just to get something that is most assuredly on the opposite floor at the time I need it - I want a RANCH! :-) I would love about 22-2500 sq feet with an open concept kitchen with a family/play room off of it. A nice sized back yard with a good tree or two and at least 15 feet on each side away from neighbors! (we currently have a set of neighbors on one side who are very loud - even heard the \"f\" bomb being dropped last night when they were having a fight!)  \n",
      "I think it's wonderful and mature that you are already considering your options and pondering what type of future you would like. My one piece of advice for you, since you are looking at adoption a bit farther down the road (later 20s), why not try to do some volunteer work or tutoring with children in the age range you might like to adopt to gain some experience and insight into children? You mentioned that you don't have much experience with children yet and this could be an ideal way to gain some understanding. Good luck to you. I do know several individuals with Aspergers and they are high functioning as well. I'm sorry that there is such a lack of understanding out there. Hopefully by the time you are ready to adopt, there will be more acceptance of it.  \n",
      "I would like a little advice on our situation. We have a semi OA where we send pics and a letter 1x a month for the 1st year and we did agree to send pic/letter updates 1x a quarter for the 2nd & 3rd year. We intend to keep sending the updates over the years, beyond that. So here's where things get a little...uncomfortable/weird/unsure. After placement, we found out that several things our son's bparents told us were untrue. Our son was drug exposed and went through withdrawal. To our face, she said he was having a formula allergy. The hospital lab work showed otherwise....They gave us some background social info that was untrue (though that seemed more like trying to \"save face\" on some life circumstances, so I can understand and empathize). The one thing that really bothered us though was criminal history. We found out through hospital paperwork that both had a criminal history. A quick check of our municipal records search (and I know some will say it wasn't my business, but when trust is at stake, I feel it is.) showed that they were extensive with some very serious issues. Anyway, long story short, they contacted us a couple of weeks ago to update their address and asked if they could have our address if they wanted to send our son something (they said they might want to). Neither my DH and I are comfortable with that due to the fact that we just are not sure we can trust them. Part of it is the criminal history and drug use and the other part is that we just don't know we can trust what they say. We have the option of using the agency as a go between which we do for the updates and I reminded them that things need to go through the agency through the 1st year. They mentioned wanting our address at least twice. DH is adamant that we retain our privacy as much as possible. They have our cell number and we have corresponded through text and some calls, though that was not in our original agreement. I know we can get a post office box too. So I'm wondering, should we be honest with them and just say we don't feel comfortable with giving out that info? Should we be honest and say that we feel we need time to build real trust and a rapport? Should we let them know that we know some of what they told us is untrue and that has led us to be guarded? I don't want to discourage them from contact and we have more contact than originally agreed upon, but I'm not sure how to proceed. Thanks for any thoughts!  \n",
      "RavenSong I am curious, though, about why the hospital even had any information about their criminal backgrounds. Granted I haven't worked in a hospital setting for many years now, but it kind of surprised me when I read that part. Raven, I'm not sure if what I saw was supposed to be included in our son's hospital notes to us, but it was attached to his nursery notes from the hospital SW regarding the conversation they had with his bmom when they informed her of the toxicology results. The SW noted that the bdad was present and had made a statement that he had just been released from jail which was why he was late to the hospital. Bmom made statements to the SW which were noted asking the SW if she had to involve the authorities and she was worried about that due to priors. SW told her that she didn't since he was being adopted, but tried to talk about drug counseling and was told she wasn't using. There were other SW notes that were unsettling, but don't want to go into them since I didn't reference them in my OP. I don't know if they should have been kept from us or not, but were part of the official nursery notes which is why I'm guessing I got them.  \n",
      "Thanks for the replies everyone! I really like the idea of saying we aren't \"ready\" rather than \"comfortable.\" This is why I love this forum - you get so many perspectives and ideas! I just heard from Bmom yesterday and apparently, they have split up which may be why we are hearing more from them. I got the feeling that they think the other will either get more contact or try to block contact. I assured bmom that we are happy to send 2 separate updates and will do that going forward. I also think that since N's 1st bday is approaching that maybe they feel unsure of how contact will continue. I assured her that we would still send updates. All in all it was a good call and I'm glad that things seem to make a little more sense. Apparently they've been apart for a few months - it was unclear really how long and I didn't want to pry. I hope they both do well on their new paths. With time and taking things slow, who knows how things can develop?  \n",
      "Hi Everyone, Since we finalized in 2012, I'm compiling stuff for ATC. I'm just wondering roughly how long it took people from the time they filed, to get their refund. I know the credit is not refundable, but with our situation, we expect to get a sizable portion of it. So from the time you filed to the time you received your refund, how long did it take you and how many times did you have to resubmit documents? I'm expecting it to take about 8 or 9 months from what I've read on here in the past, but should I just assume longer? Thank you!  \n",

      "PP have all given great ideas. We built through a popular builder in our area and if there was one thing that we could do all over again it would be to NOT be one of the first families in a new development. By that I mean to wait and really see how the neighborhood develops. We built during the first phase and if we had waited a bit, would have chosen to build elsewhere. The area didn't \"take off\" like the builder thought. Several nearby retail projects fell through (which would have added things like a pharmacy, grocery, and bank nearby). When they fell through they got replaced with a carry-out, a bar, and a dollar store - kinda disappointing. Also the builder told us about plans they had for later phases that included a bike path which they later removed in order to place more houses. Again disappointing. Lastly, had we waited to see how the neighborhood developed, we would have seen that there were relatively few families with young children and that many homes were not well cared for right from the start. We are stuck here for now because when the market sank, our area was hard hit with foreclosures - no one is buying anything that is not a short sale or repo in our neighborhood. One neighbor has a beautiful home from top to bottom with a gorgeous finished basement and great yard, but he can't even get close to what he paid for it, let alone put into it over the years. His house has been on the market for months with no little interest. Building can be a lot of fun and excitement and wonderful experience when it all comes together though. Every market is different. Good luck!  \n",

      "Dickons  Like it or not - poverty plays a role in choices and it is asking a larger question of that type of choice...it is also asking how we view those in poverty...how agencies are framing things and whether they are working to remove societal bias or enhancing it...  Dickons I think we are total agreement here. It IS something that should be studied, but studied in a responsible, thorough way. I don't think anyone is confused about anything in the title, however the title itself was lacking in saying what the interviews were pertaining to. I simply thought it was 15 interviews with varying experiences on adoption, but was surprised when I read it. I also was surprised that Dr. Sweeney was a professor as I thought I was reading the work of someone who was working on their Masters or PhD it was that lacking in substance. I don't think anyone is arguing the point about poverty and adoption- I just think a better study needs to be conducted.  \n",
      "Zeke11Thank-you for the explanation. I was completely floored when I found out that DS's original birth certificate would be sealed and changed. I thought that was archaic! We have an open adoption. It seems it should be a choice. If the BP want a completely closed adoption, I understand to some degree about sealing it. But really? In an open adoption, he has a relationship with his birthmom. How do I explain that the state of OH decided to change his birth certificate to match our names. Adoption doesn't change who he was born to! Zeke, You may know this already, but in Ohio, yes the OBC is placed in the adoption record and sealed, but if your adoption has taken place after 1986, the APs can request the non-identifying info for the child when he/she is 18 and then when the child (or rather adult adoptee) is 21, they can request their file. There is one hitch - if the BPs signed an affidavit that states that they don't want to be identified ever, then their names are removed from whatever documents they appear on. Since you have an OA, it seems unlikely they would have done that. Also, you can request the OBC prior to finalization as long as you know the Bmother's name. The BF's name can be left blank. You also need to know what city your child was born in. Ohio is an open records state meaning that anyone can request the BC for anyone as long as they have the basic info of DOB, Bmoms name, and place of birth. We were able to obtain our little guy's OBC for him because we knew both BPs names. We indicated that they request was for genealogical purposes on the form. Every state is different though -some will not allow general public access.  \n",
      "Hi Hannah!My best tip for you would use pictures that honestly reflect your life and the people and things important to you as a couple. Make sure your pictures are clear and label them. Our agency asked that we include pictures of any family who live with us (other children, relatives), pets, our home, and any activities that we do on a regular basis. Most importantly be yourself. You are just trying to give someone a look at your life.As for verbiage, I would check with your agency. There definitely seems to be some preferences on terminology. Our agency asked everyone to start it with \"Dear Birthparent(s)\", but many others would say not too. Good Luck!  \n",
      "Zeke11Ohio has no laws regarding paternity rights regardless of how the child was conceived. And, if coercion is the route by which TPR is signed, then he will be able to come back later and regain rights. Mandy Hi Mandy, I think they meant to tell you that Ohio has no paternity laws regarding how the child was conceived affecting rights. A small wording difference that makes a huge legal difference. Also, at the time TPR occurs, there are several questions that pertain to coercion. Should the EF answer that he was not coerced and that he is making the choice freely, he would have a difficult time coming back later. He would have to have strong proof of coercion. 12 months after finalization (you can finalize 6 months after placement) all adoptions are irrevocable regardless of appeal. Meet with them and ask to talk with him. Suggest attorneys for both EM and EF so that everyone's rights are protected. Be clear with both parties what your hope is - that both are making their choice freely and independently. In Ohio, stat rape is iffy - it's really up to each county how much they will go after someone, especially if the age gap is narrow (i.e. high school boyfriend/girlfriend) and the underage party admits willingness. That being said, some prosecutors in the smaller towns and more rural counties will go after the person of age if the family is really pressing it. I've heard of one case here where the boy was 19 the girl 17 and they prosecuted because her parents were pressing it. The boy eventually cut a deal and it really has hurt his future - he's now a registered sex offender. I hope in your everyone is treated fairly. Good luck!  \n",
      "Alexa,I understand. What I don't think a lot of birthmoms can understand from the AP point of view (because they may not have lived that just as we have not experienced being a birthmom) is just how much you want to do the \"right\" thing not the \"wrong\" thing. How frazzled your nerves are and how you're just trying to deal with the whole thing. You have people coming at you from all sides telling you what you should, shouldn't do, should feel, not feel and it is hard. You are literally at the mercy and whims of another person and it is hard. As for a gift for the emom - we gave our birthmom (and yes, she is now his birthmom) a photo album. Pictures were important to her and I wanted to show her that we would be sending plenty of pics to fill that album. I get your statement about wanting to show gratitude for her choosing you. Our birthmom kept thanking us over and over and I was uncomfortable with that because I felt like we were being placed on some type of pedestal and I didn't want that. When she kept thanking us, I said back that I thanked her for choosing us to be his parents. It was all verbal. Each situation is unique and however you decide to handle it, go with your best intentions to show care and concern and you'll be fine.  \n",
      "I know we talked about SIDS on another thread about a month ago and I re-read it. Baby Boy has had a small cold this week and it brought back those SIDS fears and worries. We had a humidifier going to help with congestion and such, but after looking at a site that Fran mentioned, I did a little more researching about mattress wrapping. Has anyone tried it? I figure it would be a very small price to pay for a little more peace of mind. The thing is, in looking at reviews the only negative reviews I've found are ones from people who haven't tried it, but feel it's a waste of money. I'm just wondering if anyone has tried the product and what they thought of it. Any difficulty using it, etc... The theory behind it is very interesting and does make some sense.

      "The first thing that comes to mind for me is how would a birthfamily feel if and adoptive family told everyone they knew that either the bparents were deceased or in jail, or had a closed adoption (when it wasn't) or some other lie in order to avoid uncomfortable questions? The issue really falls back upon the person who told the lie because either a) they have no intention of ever having a relationship with the person whom they lied about (ie how do you explain suddenly a relative coming back from the dead?) or b) they just don't care who they tell what story to. It's one thing to be vague such as saying \"they aren't with me\" or something to deflect questions, but saying someone is deceased pretty much sends a message that you won't be having a relationship. I don't think that you can confront or call out the uncle who started the lie, but at the same time if you run into people who have heard it, you can simply state, \"nope he's alive and well\" and just look confused as in \"I have no idea why uncle joe would have said such a thing\". You have no responsibility to \"uncle joe\" to help him save face. In a small town, it's really hard to play that game, but I would probably feel hurt for my child, angry at being pulled into a lie, and shocked all at the same time.  \n",

      "purejoy Does anyone else wonder how Isaiah's name became Caleb? Naming the baby was one of Claudia's two \"wants\" for her adoption plan. One example of them not showing the whole story... it kind of bothers me. I did catch that, but because Claudia said how happy she was with the adoptive family, I assumed that maybe she really liked them and decided that them keeping the name was not as big a deal as she originally thought. I thought she still named him Isaiah for the OBC though. And you are correct about them not showing the whole story because there was no mention at all about financial issues. I think the show though was geared more towards the emotions and the experience of adoption rather than the process.  \n",
      "There are a lot of ways to look at it. Yes, many agencies say you will wait longer if you have children, especially bio children. They also say to be yourself in your profile book/letter. The question is, would you want to match with someone who didn't share your values? Would that cause friction later if you were having an open adoption? For instance, if a bmom wanted her child to be an only child and that went against your values and future plans, the match would probably not be in anyone's best interest. We faced a similar issue having a bio child (and truthfully, I hate that term) and I decided for our final profile, to address the \"elephant in the room,\" so to speak against the advice of our SW. We talked about our wish for a large family and the positive benefits having multiple children bring to a family. We also talked about how we parent and discipline and how we will parent and discipline both children. We also addressed the unspoken question about whether we would love a child adopted as we would a bio child. We explained how we viewed children and love and that absolutely we would love them as unique individuals regardless of their dna. I don't know if it helped to address it or hurt us, but it made me feel a lot better about our profile and felt that it really reflected who we are. I also stressed throughout the profile that we welcomed questions and discussion about our family. I hate to say it this way because it sounds trite, but there is no other analogy I can think of - it's like a job interview (but the stakes are way higher) - you have to ask for the job and invite the \"interviewer\" to want to talk to you. I know a lot of agencies will advise against that but I felt like it was the only control in the process that we truly had. Good luck and please never feel like you have to downplay your child. Every child is such a precious gift no matter how they joined your family!  \n",

He may also be picking up some type of sign that he's expected to have recognition or a special relationship with her and is confused because she's a stranger. It's kind of like the grandma that lives away and sees the family only a few times a year. To a little one, she's just a person, but there's the \"but it's grandma!!\" attitude and it doesn't quite make sense. Keep going - as his memory expands his shyness will fade.

      "Has her therapist made any suggestions about how to talk about it or give her facts? It's such a rock and hard place, because the fantasies only reinforce her inability to attach, but they also serve to protect her from feeling rejected by her biomom. As an adult I can't imagine how I would feel being sold for drugs or left with strangers or locked in a closet, but for a child having survived that at the hands of someone who is supposed to love and protect you? That's heartbreaking. The best suggestion I can offer and I'm sure that you already follow it, is when you do give her facts, give them a little at a time and calmly and with follow up statements such as \"We used to live in a big house with a pool... - Sweetheart that sounds like it would have been nice, but that's not what happened. I wish it could have been, but you moved a lot when you were little and the places were unsafe which is one of the reasons why you are here with daddy and I now. We love you and will keep you safe and we are so glad you are here.\"Good luck - I feel so bad for her and for you.

We then gave him a first name and kept the other two so he has two middle names. In hindsight, I wish we hadn't as most of the time I have to explain to people that he has two middle names when making appointments, filling out paperwork etc... We also altered our top choices for a first name in lieu of a name that flowed better with the other two. There is no right or wrong answer as others have said, but please don't let yourself be pressured.

      "Alexa1981 I've heard great things about Sam's Club formula, but they come in such giant cansiters that I didn't want to buy that and then him not like it.  One thing to note about the generics that I learned after a bunch of looking around. Sams Club, Target, Walmart, Kroger, and even Babies R Us are made by the same pharma company out of Vermont. It's the same formuation whether it's in the walmart or target etc. package which is awesome! We are doing 1/2 Similac Advance and 1/2 generic Enfamil AR. Weird I know, but sweet boy needs the AR formula due to some moderate reflux and it's working really well. The Similac AR formula uses corn syrup solids as its 1st ingredient which I really don't like, but the Enfamil AR formula uses no corn syrup. The generics roll the same way. We first switched to the sensitive formula and while he did okay on it, suddenly became this eating machine and was taking a lot of formula and putting on a lot of weight. I have to wonder if it's because the sensitive formulas (both brands) use the corn syrup as their first ingredient? The other thing we found was that he had trouble using generic advance only - he was getting somewhat constipated with a lot of gas pain. I know the packaging says that while probiotics are in the formula, the quantity of the generic is not necessarily equal to that of the brand. I would suggest starting with a smaller container and seeing how it goes. I did learn that Costco's Kirkland brand claims to be manufactured by Costco, but I'm not a Costco member so can't say for certain. Good luck! We use regular tap water here after using bottled water the first 6 weeks and all seems to be okay.  \n",

      "Robin it's okay to be scared. I totally get it. Our situation was a little different, but also similar in that we have a DD who we conceived through IF treatments and is now just 13. We tried for over 10 years to get pregnant again then turned to adoption. After waiting nearly 2 1/2 years we got \"the call\" about a sweet baby born. Everything happened so fast, but I am sure glad we said yes. Yes it's a huge change and yes I would say it's a little harder physically in my 40s handling the fatigue part. But I also know that that time passes quickly and even now just 2 months later am getting way more sleep than in those first couple of weeks. I remember the day before we went to pick him up asking myself similar questions that you are asking about am I too old, has too much time passed? Honestly, I feel that the 40s is not too old to parent. I feel I can bring something to the proverbial table at 40 that I couldn't at 28. Anyway, please know that there are positive adoption stories and the idea of negative things being \"bred\" into a child are, well only as true as it is for anyone in the general population. Just because a child is adopted does not make them any more likely to inherit something. Make sure that you are getting all the social medical info on this baby that you can so that you can decided what you can and cannot live with. Only you can decide if drug exposure is something you can handle. The same goes for alcohol/cigarette use and any family history of mental illness. Ask questions of your social worker so that you can make the decision that feels right for you and your family in the long run! Good luck!  \n",

      "For an open and even semi-open adoption to work there has to be some fluidity and flexibility. I'm sorry, but I don't think a binding written agreement would work - even with scheduled re-negotiation because at the heart of it is a child, not an object or possession. If one party doesn't uphold their end of the agreement, what is the repercussion? You can't repo the child like a loan default, financial penalty? (What would that solve?) Also looking at the dynamic, there is no accountability for the bparent(s). If a bparent disappears and doesn't keep contact? What then? If such a legal arrangement would work, then you would see more marriages going to them - the stakes are way higher when you are living with that person day in and day out. I know that originally we only agreed to pictures and letter updates, but then we gave the bmom our phone and names. We had considered offering visits if the relationship progressed, but that is not an option right now as we have learned about a big bunch of lies that she has told us as well as drug use. So we haven't gone back on our word, but we are not open to anything extra at this time. I also wish that she did not have our phone number or full names. If we had had such an agreement in place that included visits, I would feel highly uncomfortable doing them with what we have learned since placement. We did not lie to her, but she sure did lie to us.  \n",
      "[QUOTE=Dickons]And with a written contract defining the pictures and letters and that if XYZ happens the contract is broken then you have the written contract to clearly identify exactly what you agreed to - no he said she said...  I completely understand what you are saying, but I think that still contracting an adoption like any other legal contract treats the child like property. At best, how do you contract a relationship? I think having a written agreement would still lead bparents to feel like they have some type of rights and truthfully that just isn't the case. I think it would be better to counsel bparents on the fact that after you sign unfortunately your rights are gone as is the ability to make any demands regarding openness. They can make requests, but it really does fall to the APs to agree to it. How to do a better job ensuring that APs are honest and uphold what they say they will do? How about better training on how to form, grow, and nurture the relationship? How about some counseling for bparents about the same? We were given all types of \"suggestion\" lists on what to converse about at a first meeting with PBparents. I would love to see some type of list for bparents that helps them see how to build a strong relationship with the afamily. Just as not every bparent is dishonest or addicted, or full of drama, some are. Its those that are that will have a huge problem with any agreement regardless of whether it's on a piece of paper or not. I also have to wonder, if lets say years down the road someone wants a mediator, I would bet 9 times out of 10 the aparents are expected to foot the bill. At some point the \"aparents are responsible for all costs\" mentality has to stop. I'm really not trying to beat up on bparents, but the adoption industry has gotten so good at pushing the terms open and semi-open on all members of the triad, that people are developing an \"anything goes attitude.\" Every adoption is unique and different. We did not receive very good education on how to grow the relationship, but were told more that \"just let it happen.\" I would rather have education than mandates.  \n",

Only you can know when you are ready to start trying again, but I guess you have to ask yourself can you grieve while you wait?

After our failure we were back in the waiting pool as soon as the SW got off the phone with the failed match. I would probably feel better using an agency as a screener, but that's just me. Are you able to use a referral service where you are? That could at least be another way to search. Good luck - I'll be praying for you.  \n",
      "nazegeI came across this thread because it was posted by a birthmother on a social media site. You may not have realized how much feedback this has created. I'll spare you the details only to say that while she has made decisions in her life that have gotten her where she is today and there are probably emotional/psychological barriers in her life that also hinder her from being able to parent this child, can we not spare just a shread of compassion for the woman who did give birth to this child and attempt to parent her? I am sure she cannot understand that her decisions have actually resulted in permanent loss of this child but it is what it is, a substantial loss in her life that will never go away. While you rejoice in your adoption, she will suffer. Please try to be a little sensitive and appreciative of that. She isn't going to fully accept this, short of God's intervention and her understanding of His will. While I fully made my own choice to seek adoption for my daughter, she did not. That is just going to add to her pain. I would also strongly urge you to stop checking on her facebook page. If my adoptive family were voyeuristically peering into my life without my knowledge, at the very least I would be hurt, never mind offended. I wouldn't do that to them, I respect their right to privacy. Please pray for this woman. Her days ahead are going to be very painful. I think you missed what the OP's point was - she is worried that she is possibly missing information as to a reunification date and was looking for support. As to privacy, where facebook goes, sadly all bets are off. Just as you were able to link up to this thread from another site, a simple google search of this person would take you to her facebook page. If you sets everything as public....well..... We are not advocating a lack of compassion, but the fact is she was given a plan and was literally at reunification when she blew it. The OP is simply picking up the pieces and becoming the parent that those children need. This is not a typical bparent/adoptive parent situation. This is foster to adopt. The issue is not about facebook privacy, but the OP was seeking clarification if she could be missing any info on the PCC process.  \n",

It makes me wonder if this happens a lot and if that is something that can be considered when PAP's are making an adoption plan. Does the expectant mother need to be clean and sober and have her wits about her to make a plan and sign on the dotted line? Interesting spin I think.That is a big can of worms so to speak. I know that part of the surrender process in our state requires the bparents to be asked if they are under the influence of any drugs or alcohol that could impair their ability to make a decision. No drug test is required in order to surrender. So if you are and answer no then contest because you really are, should CPS be called? Also, do you have any proof that you were then, but then what about now? I can see that sending things in the direction of requiring drug tests prior to signing if a bunch of contests arose as a result. Also, if you are, but you do want to sign and saying yes would prevent that and/or CPS would be called, you might lie to hide that? Such a big can of worms - it's a no win for any party involved, but especially the child(ren)!  \n",

      "So our sweet baby N has been home just about 3 weeks now and I've heard pretty regularly from his birthmom. Recently I got a weird series of emails where it felt like she was progressively asking for money. First there was one issue with a bill needing paid, then another issue, now recently another issue. She never quite comes out and asks for money, but rather a \"don't know what to do\" sort of thing. Then she'll swing things back to being glad he's got a comfortable life with us, etc... Am I overthinking or am I being manipulated? I really felt like she was asking for money in the last email. I told her to contact the lawyer who was handling the bp expenses to see what he could do to help (unless she's used all of the money, there should be plenty there to pay those bills?!) I just don't know exactly what to make of this and of course it terrifies me that something could go wrong in all of this. TPR is irrevocable in our state, but I can't help but worry! Thoughts?  \n",
      "Thanks everyone! I guess only time will tell how this relationship grows. We really want this to be healthy for everyone and I just don't want to see that kind of drama get in the way. The emails stopped after I referred to the lawyer. Just for clarification, we are using an agency, she has her own lawyer. I really hope that she can get help if she truly needs it. It's still really early in all this, so we'll see how the boundary issue goes.  \n",
      "Karen,I'm so glad you were able to take her and have a good visit. It's a memory that she can hold on to. I'm so sorry you and your family have to go through this. <<<<Hugs>>>>  \n",
      "Congratulations Smiles! Enjoy your happy day - it's a great reason to celebrate!  \n",
      "mshell I found an adoption specific baby book on Amazon that I really liked plus I've been keeping a journal of our experience up to this point and now journaling directly to M to tell his story. I probably will do some type of scrapbook as the days go by, but for now, I want to record as much as I can. I also do a \"time capsule\" of memorabilia for my daughter and will start one for him too!  \n",
      "smokie, please don't feel guilty or bad for deciding to parent your child - it is every mother's right to make that decision. I'm so sorry that you were treated so terribly. I don't think any adoptive parent on this board would want to become a parent as a result of that type of treatment of any birth mother. I'm so sorry that your child passed away. I can only imagine the grief and will say a prayer for you for healing. Hugs to you this mother's day.  \n",
      "So beautiful. You had me choked up. I can't but help thinking about little one's birthmother today. Your prayer said it all. Thank you!  \n",
      "Dear A.com friends Mother's Day has come early for us! We got the call about a baby born (Linny I thought of you!) last week and after meeting his incredible birthparents (I just am so thankful and amazed at these people that God has brought into our lives!) we matched and brought our son home! He's perfect and beautiful and I can't hardly believe it. I just stared at him sleeping in his bassinet today and said, \"wow, you are here, really here!\" This was a rollercoaster journey for sure, but as we crested the final hill this time there was no drop just a smooth pull into home! I just can't believe how incredibly blessed we are and so lucky that he found us!  \n",
      "Hi Heather,I did pose this same question to our SW when we went through our update meeting last month and in Ohio, if your placement comes from Ohio, yes your homestudy has to be valid through finalization. I don't know about other states, so if hypothetically a placement came from out of state and you followed the laws of that state and finalized there they may have a different requirement? Does that make sense? It's early! :-0  \n",
      "I just wanted to wish you well allwhohope. I hope things go smoothly for you. Having been through a failed match, I can understand your feelings. I truly wish there was a better way in our country. I think we all are just trying to navigate the world of adoption the best we can. Good luck!  \n",
      "Honestly, months can go by and not hear from anyone, but in fairness to them, they say we are welcome to call anytime. I feel stupid calling too often because....well...they can't really tell me what I need to hear which is WHEN WILL IT HAPPEN! :-) But they are all usually very kind and supportive and positive when I do talk to them. One thing my DH said he wished they did just to keep connected was a monthly email newsletter - doesn't have to be long, could have a couple of adoption articles (like some ongoing education and point of view pieces) as well as updates, like how many families are they working with, how many have been placed. Stuff like that.Sometimes I wish that they had a waiting families support group, but I also know that would be hard because let's face it, someone will be first and someone will be last and for those waiting the longest it would be hard to watch everyone come and go. Just my .02!  \n",
      "Luv, my sympathies on your loss. That's a tough blow. With that being said, everyone is different, especially how they handle death and funeral issues. Is she insensitive? Yes. Is it a trigger? Yes. But is she intending to hurt or offend anyone? Who knows. The irony is that she is your step not biological mother - I wonder if she feels that makes her relationship with you any less real or valid? Hopefully not! She's grieving too and hopefully not intending to hurt anyone. I have always felt that what mattered more in obits is the relationship each person had with the deceased. I come from a family that has had many \"uncles\" and \"aunts\" that were in relationship, but not blood/bio and we've always considered them as such. Maybe kindly remind her that those family members were living, breathing relationships to your dad and much more than just \"bio\" this and that and to please honor them too. Again, my sympathies. Funerals are a really tough time for everyone and sometimes people just don't think...  \n",
      "Something interesting that I learned: Check with your agency/SW/or attorney as to whether or not your state has any laws about when an emom can request to match. In our state the agency has to accept any emom requesting adoption and has to attempt to match her when she wants to - so if she's 2 months along...they have to show her profiles and attempt to match her. Now PAPs don't have to accept a match if they want and if no PAPs want to match for that emom, then she can choose to match elsewhere, but they do have to try. I was stunned when I learned that - I thought the agencies could set their own policy.  \n",
      "I didn't know where else to turn to vent this first because right now I'm just fighting to not pick up the phone and yell, email a nasty message, or just flat out cry. I just went over to our agency's website to look at our profile. They've been playing with new formats over the past 6 months and it seems like it's now pulled together. So I click on the \"Waiting Families\" link and now they've added a \"gallery\" of profiles with a much smaller \"See all waiting families\" link. We, who have been waiting nearly 2 full years (process started well over 2 years ago now) and are in the middle of updating our homestudy, and are in the first 10 families on the waiting list are NOT in the gallery. Families who have just started waiting are in the gallery. A couple of the families in the previously mentioned first 10 are, but the majority are newly waiting families. I am so mad, so hurt, so angry. I've asked for feedback on our profile as to whether something's \"missing' that gets us overlooked, if it's not warm enough, or whatever and get nothing....zip...just told that's there's no prediciting (which I do get). But still to not even make the highlighted gallery just feels like even they've given up on us! What the heck am I supposed to do now? We are actually meeting our SW this week for our update visit, and I will say something, but should I also contact the office directly? I am shaking right now, I am so upset.:hissy: :grr:  \n",
      "Thanks for the comments everyone. I've checked the site multiple times today and the gallery does not change. I know that the person who does their web is doing it as a side job and is related to someone who works at the agency. It took over a month to get our profile changed the last time we updated it. It's very, very frustrating. I do plan on emailing Monday morning, but I really want them to understand just how frustrating all this is. There is so little we can control and there is so little in this process that is \"fair\", but this should be one of those things. You just don't put someone on a pictorial who has only been waiting 6 weeks and leave out someone who has been waiting 2 years! (And has had a failed match from them at that!)I want to turn this thing around and get back on the positive road. We've had several screw ups with them and it's making us feel really 2nd rate. We just want them to walk the walk that they talked.  \n",
      "Hi, I'm erinandwill and my DH and I have been trying to adopt domestically for 2 years now. We are in the process of updating our homestudy. We have 1 biological child who is now 13! We've been through primary and secondary IF. We had one match last fall that ended very badly. I joined a.com to learn more about adoption and gain support as the wait is very hard (as a pp mentioned). I'm trying very hard to trust God's plan.  \n",
      "Yehudit what a difficult situation that many of us know too well. I guess my question is what is she doing that is out of control or makes your friend think so? Yes counseling can help, but so can being allowed to grieve. What she has gone through plainly sucks and there are a lot of ugly feelings that come out during it. I would ask if she wants to talk, letting her know that you're concerned about her. If she's behaving in a way that is dangerous to herself and others, by all means recommend professional help. I remember clearly less than 2 weeks after our failed match, my sister asking me why I was \"down\" and when I broke down and told her that life was plainly sucky at that time she suggested that I needed counseling. I told her I disagreed - that I was only 2 weeks out of this and hurt and angry and had a right to be. We don't know all the issues surrounding your friend's failed match that could contribute to her still having a hard time so I can't advise on whether she's in need of professional help or not. Good luck to you and to her - it's a pain that I don't wish on anyone.  \n",
      "Welcome Silkshadoe! I cannot imagine what you must be going through! I've no experience to go on, but would trust your attorney on this.

I wish you luck as you take the next step to permanence!  \n",
      "lovemy2boysWell, as a lifelong practicing Catholic, I can say that you can free your mind of this picture because it is grossly inaccurate.Actually, I am too, but unfortunately in our town this message is being blasted loud and clear along with the veiled message of \"if you don't support this new push of protecting first amendment rights where it pertains to the church, then you are a sinner.

They don't have to pay him for the extra time off is my understanding, but he should be able to take off 12 weeks under FMLA. Poor guy- there is no way I could ever be ready to return to work in just 2 weeks!  \n",
      "I second what JCM said! I'm trying to look at it from A point of view. Is it fair that he has no Mommy or Daddy in his everyday life? You adopted him legally and ARE his mommy and daddy. I just think that is unfair to A- little's need a mommy and daddy. It feels like the counselor is treating you like you're just babysitting and that someday, your daughter will resume her role as parent. I'm shocked that a post adoption counselor would be so insensitive!  \n",

      "I just want to know what other women are experiencing on their path to adoption. When we went through the homestudy, DH helped with things like cleaning. He went to all appointments, etc..Filling out paperwork was left up to me. Doing our profile was primarily left up to me as he has no computer experience. Now as we sit and wait, it feels like all of this is on my shoulders. He'll ask if I've contacted our agency (he rarely emails anyone). Any back and forth between us and the agency is up to me. Any research on other agencies or pathways is left up to me. He did see a story about a different agency in the paper and pointed it out to me, but to contact them was up to me. Please don't get me wrong - he wants to adopt and is excited to adopt, but seems to take the \"I don't know what to do\" approach. He told me last night that he's feeling discouraged. I feel that way too, but I don't know what else to do, but keep exploring other avenues. What are other DH's doing out there?:grr:  \n",
      "Gosh everyone - thank you for the reassurance that we're pretty much normal on this! As a pp noted, they have to do the ordinary household stuff like bills, appointments, etc.. as well. That's pretty much the same here too! But DH will do all the yard work without complaint or prompting so I'm lucky on that!  \n",
      "I saw this when it first came out a little while back and am stunned the courts ever approved this sham of an adoption. It is so clear what he's trying to do to protect his assets. I hadn't heard the extra part about charges of molestation, but I think they'd have a hard time proving it without her cooperation. I also can't believe that she went along with it. Just weird and creepy and sad what someone will do for/to protect money!  \n",
      "Hi everyone, Just looking for some BTDT advice. DH and I are at the realization that we most likely need to go out of state to find an adoption situation. Because 1/2 of our money is already tied up with an agency, our budget is narrowed - not unworkable, but narrowed. We are thinking of listing on PP rather than working with a 2nd agency who would require additional fees, but using an attorney in the expectant mother's state should we be matched/chosen. I'm trying to get an idea of what to expect for attorney fees. Do most states charge an ICPC fee for the paperwork (I assume they do)? I think we can afford this if we go the route of an attorney rather than going through another agency that would charge their fees plus legal. Any thoughts on if this is a good idea or bad either way (using an attorney over an agency)? I'm not horribly worried about travel costs and ICPC lost time at work because my job is pretty flexible. As I understand it, my DH wouldn't need to stay there the entire time - he could go home to work during the week right? (Or are there states that require both parents to stay the entire time?) Any states that are very hard to work with ICPC? Thanks for any help.  \n",
      "We went with a smaller agency with fees due in spaced out payments with roughly half due at placement. I wish now we had just paid more, gone with a larger agency, with all fees due at placement because now 1/2 our money is tied up with an agency that is gettng us nowhere. We've had one failed match and difficulty getting them to communicate. I keep thinking that had we gone with the larger, more expensive agency, we would possibly be parents by now. Good luck - there's a lot of options out there and you have to find the one that works best for you!  \n",
      "Beautiful! I love it!  \n",
      "Hey kcf, I too have followed your story and I guess, I just want to add, that you and your DH don't have to give her everything she wants just because she's starting drama again (I know you know this! :-) There is nothing wrong with saying that you will try a supervised visit with her alone and see how it goes. If she brings additional people with her then you will leave immediately and visits will be terminated until she agrees to the boundaries. I would suggest having either a social worker or lawyer present just as a witness. Spell out the conditions - how she refers to your son and his new \"relatives\" and let her know what you will accept or no visits. The big worry I have for you is her erratic and sometimes violent behavior. Spell out what will not be tolerated. I would suggest trying to use positive language because she won't like the rules, but keep stressing that you want the best relationship for all of you, especially since she is your daughter too. If she has attitude or behaves in a way that is negative to you or your DH, then that is her choice. I wish you luck!  \n",

      "TxSW07 Everyone always says that the right Birth Mom will know we're the right family, but after so much time has gone by it makes you wonder. OMG, I really hate that phrase along with \"the right baby finds the right family at the right time...\" That falls in line (for me) with \"Everything happens for a reason\" \"It was meant to be\" etc... The reason I hate those phrases? Because for those families for whom it doesn't work out, you feel even more like some type of cosmic failure. Even the \"universe\" felt you were unfit to be parents, kwim? I do understand that often things can't be explained. The phrase I do like, is something along the lines of \"some things can't be explained and one day we'll know God's plans in the afterlife.\" But that's just me. If certain beliefs help people get through this crazy thing called life then that's okay too. My point is that I just do not know if adoption really will happen for us. Due to our ages, DH and I have agreed to renew our homestudy this summer for one more 2yr period and then that's it. If we haven't been placed after that, then it's over. So will things happen for us in the next 2 1/2 years - I just don't know. But I do know that to survive this struggle to build a family and to be a pretty happy person IRL, I do have to remain guarded and remind myself that this may not happen for us. It's not to be negative - it's just to accept my reality. We are being shown again next week and I just have to put it out of my head. Luck to all!  \n",

      "She should consult a lawyer for laws in her state regarding birth father rights. I do know in some states that a birth father once informed of the pregnancy needs to show some level of support such as financial, emotional, etc. and if they do not can have their rights terminated on a case by case basis. If she really wants to make an adoption plan, she should notify him in a certified letter of her pregnancy and ask his intentions of support then document, document, document. It may require some work on her part to be able to place ethically against his wishes. In many cases, inability to pay financial support isn't necessarily enough cause to terminate his rights as long as he's making an attempt to have regular contact and be present in his child's life. I would hate to see anyone who wanted to parent be denied that right if they truly wanted to parent. She could still choose to terminate her rights, but her child could end up in foster care limbo while the state attempts to contact him and see if he wants to parent or have a relative parent. I wish her luck - it's sure between a rock and hard place to be in.  \n",

      "Hi TxS and welcome! Perhaps be honest about your failed match with something like, \"we're sort of nervous, but very excited too. We did have a failed match back in April and that was very painful and hard to go through.\" I think emoms should be told either by the PAPs or the SW when they are picking the family so that they can understand that this is very much a two way street. No one has the market on hurts and disappointments. Good luck!  \n",
      "I just found out that the emom who we were matched with registered for baby items just a couple of weeks after we were matched. We were matched for 9 weeks total before it failed. She let us stay \"on the hook\" so to speak for weeks, taking us out of being shown to anyone else. I honestly don't feel mad - I've moved away from that, but I do feel stunned. What I learned changes nothing, but I do pity her - she had no regard for us or our feelings. She had no intention of placing for adoption. This just further confirms it. Sad girl... I've also learned that I really need to be \"on guard\" with our SW and stay on top of things. I've learned some things about how she handled another botched match that were alarming. I truly never thought adopting would be this hard. Stupid, naive me!  \n",
      "Sunday Can you request a different SW too? xoxo Ugh - I wish! Unfortunately they are assigned regions and she is the only one for our region.

We've also made our \"non-negotiable list\" and the first thing on it is waiting time of no more than 6 weeks to due date and no match earlier than 4 and only if there is a clear discussion about staying in contact between us and emom and if emom does not then we end the match immediately. Its not to be unfair to emoms - its only to protect ourselves and to further our goal of an open adoption.Anyway - thank you ladies for making me smile first thing this morning!  \n",

At the very least they need to explain why they told you all her paperwork was in order, but now you find out that she has no insurance. Good luck. I truly hope it works out for you.

      "Hi Grace,The first thing that came to mind for me is how much openness are they interested in and how much are you interested in. I do find the sexual assault to be unsettling - related person or not (they can use that term for step family too, so not necessarily blood relation) more from the violence of it and not from a worry about passing a genetic trait. So my concern would be that I wouldn't feel comfortable having openness that included identifying info and/or visits. If the eparents are hoping for that then that could cause some major issues. Just my .02.  \n",

I just got something from our agency the other day and it had something written to the effect of,...\"some of our birthmothers who are not yet matched...\" and I was like, Um Hello! They are emoms and if they aren't matching, then they really aren't sure about an adoption plan! Before coming to this forum, I didn't have a \"term\" for emom, but in my understanding of using \"birthmother\", I knew that she wasn't a birthmom/firstmom until after TPR, but just used that term to distinguish between someone who's working on an adoption plan versus someone who is not. Funny, I used the term \"expectant mom\" when we met the emom of our failed match and she looked at me funny and later referred to herself as a birthmom. So I think everyone just has different perspectives. Happy Sunday to all! I am very grateful to have a place to come and talk about adoption. Since our failed match, NO ONE in my family even wants to mention the word. It came up in conversation not related to us and everyone sort of froze like it was \"the word that must not be said.\" I was like, yes please let's talk about it!  \n",

      "Sarah,The only thing that really helped with my pregnancy losses was to hear that one day I would be able to hold them, love them. and feel complete with them when we are reunited in heaven. That's not a perspective that everyone shares though so I don't know if this couple would appreciate that or take comfort in that. It's such a unique experience so a simple \"thinking of you\" is most likely always appropriate. One thing I do want to say, that pp have mentioned is that please don't offer to lend an ear unless you really mean it. If she needs to talk and someone offers they need to be willing to hear it all, the good, bad, ugly, tears, anger, etc...There are a ton of emotions with loss - and people are very afraid to share them for fear of what people may think. I think it's very kind that you are thinking of this couple and want to reach out to them.  \n",
      "Hi everyone, It seems like there have been a lot of lost matches lately and as we go through this, I thought we could \"lean on\" each other for support. I know I for one have been having a hard time and have been logging on here a lot just looking for something that will make this any easier. I just wanted to see how the rest of us who have lost matches within these past few months are doing, coping etc... The holidays are coming up and it seems like no one I know outside of adoption experience has the patience for any \"sad talk\" and just can't seem to understand why we can't throw ourselves into the merry atmosphere. I'm dreading Thanksgiving - the first big family get together since our match fell apart. Anyone else? I truly don't want to be a downer, or constantly negative, or hopeless, but right now I'm hurting, I'm sad, and in the blink of an eye (or I should say phone call) a possible future was lost. One mistake I made this week: we were asked if we wanted our profile shared with an emom who was due very soon. Not wanting to turn down a possible situation or perhaps just wanting to be one of those people who could say things fell apart and then boom our baby found us, we said yes by all means share it. Another family was chosen. I think that has made this weekend so hard, the hurt worse, and just feeling like a cosmic failure all around. So anyone care to check in with how they are doing? Anything helping make it hurt less? Anyone find any good books that support this time?  \n",

      "Cricket I am so, so sorry. I wish there were words that could make any of this seem better. Please know that we're all with you and as you move through each day.  \n",
      "I think you really have to go with your gut. Hindsight of course is 20/20, but if I had to do it all over again, I would definitely be asking questions about how they communicate with PAPs and how often. We relied a lot on the referrals of friends and family and I realize that what may have been a good fit for them, may not be for us. We did only consider non-profits. We thought our agency had a good rep. for counseling (but I'm really not so sure about this now). I wish we had explored more agencies and their financial policies (money lost if match failed, how much paid upfront, etc...) as well as their matching policies. My best advice is to go with your gut, if something doesn't sound or sit right with you, don't try to make it \"fit\" just to sign with an agency. Good luck!  \n",
      "Hi! As DH and I try to sort out our next steps following our failed match, I was wondering if anyone has any experience with Adoption Link in Yellow Springs, OH that they could PM me with? We want to see if it's financially possible to switch agencies or if we can use a 2nd agency. Please PM me if you can help! Thank you!  \n",
      "Hi Sapo,Like the PP said - the age of your children is a factor as is the reason for the invol. tpr. I see that your children are between 3-6 years old. I honestly cannot imagine taking them to jail for such a visit. You could write to her, since you have the information and see if she responds. Are phone calls a possibility? I would be very leery of a visit, especially if the reason for tpr was some sort of abuse or if their goodbye meeting went poorly. I think I would ask your CW what they thought or if they had any insight about what to expect. Visit protocols differ depending on the level of security.  \n",
      "I'm so, so sorry. I wish there were some magic words to make things feel better, but I know there aren't. Just know that we are all here behind you. ((((hugs)))))  \n",
      "So we found out yesterday that our match has officially failed and that the emom is planning on parenting. We knew it could happen, we told ourselves it could happen, it still hurts. I'm not mad at anyone, but myself. I knew it wasn't a good thing for me (moreso than DH who is way more patient and not such a planner) to accept a match so far out. I know that this experience has helped shape how I feel about what time frame I can handle. I can be all logical, but I still feel just so very sad. I hate that I have to sit my 12 year old down and explain to her that once again she won't be a big sister. I hate that while we didn't tell a lot of people, I do have some very close friends and family that I have to tell. I hate this part of adoption.  \n",
      "Thanks everyone for you support and compassion. I just need to get through telling my parents and our daughter and after that, can sorta just crash. I am totally jumping on the \"baby born\" bandwagon right now. I know most likely that we will have to pre-match as that seems to be the most common situations the agency has, but would be so happy to be picked for a baby born scenario. I hope that I can find a way to trust an emom again. I hope the coming days bring better news for all of us here!  \n",
      "I just need a safe place to lay this all out. I know that everything can change at any second and back again, and again, etc..., but lately I'm not having a lot of confidence in our match. The emom who we are matched with hasn't been in contact in more than a month. This is the longest she has gone with not returning emails. She was the one who wanted to keep it to email. I have offered several times to communicate through text or calls too, but she indicated that she was happy with email. When we were matched, we were told that she wanted to get to know us (and we want to get to know her!). We were told semi to open adoption. (We are happy to include visits if she wants). It is literally say one thing and act another. I'm frustrated and anxious. I've also been waiting for a call back from our SW for the past 4 days. Hey if it's bad news, that I can take, but silence just sucks. We still have about 11 weeks to go until due date. At this point, DH and I talk very little about the situation other than \"Have you heard anything, No, You? No\" We aren't talking names or making plans - we just can't because it will hurt too much to get excited then have her change her mind. I confess that I've gone into sort of denial about being matched as in I know we're matched, but it doesn't feel like it. One thing DH and I do know and have discussed is that we will not accept another match with a due date so far out next time. See, I'm already thinking about next time! I hope the other January matches are proceeding better than this.  \n",
      "Thanks everyone! I think what I'm more anxious about is that our SW still has not called us back - not even an \"I got your message and will follow up and get back to you.\" I know that I will not say yes to such a long match again - it's just not a good thing for me or our family, but again until you experience it, you do have to take a risk right? I could be completely whiny and wrong and this could all work out - I just hate \"radio silence.\" I do try to be understanding and compassionate to what the emom may be experiencing, but I just don't know what to think or do. I dont' want to \"over-contact\" her, but I also don't want her to think that we don't care and when she misses promised contacts, I also worry about what may have happened. I plan on calling our SW again and leaving another message for her kindly reminding her that I'm waiting for her call back.  \n",
      "Thanks Jillie. I agree. I plan on staying on her (the SW), but it's a fine line. I don't want to make our SW mad and lose what support or help we do get. I do know a friend who had words with their SW when they were adopting and then had a lot of trouble getting called back. They ended up switching agencies over it because they felt that their SW had stopped communicating. Anyway, I do like our SW and usually get along fine with her, she's just slow to return calls/msgs, but not usually this slow.  \n",
      "Thanks pmorris. I keep telling myself that no news is simply no news. Unfortunately we are still in the no news stage. Still waiting to hear from SW. I have a feeling that emom is not returning her call so she has no update. I also get the feeling that SW hasn't tried to contact emom in over a month. I thought that SW would be regularly contacting emom just to see how she is, her needs, any counseling, etc.... So we wait....  \n",
      "So sorry. <<<<<hugs>>>>> We're here for you.  \n",

      "Just throwing in my .02 about ethics. While it is true that birthmothers should be able to have their choice of family, I'm wondering if the birthmom in this case was told that the family she ultimately chose had previously backed out? What I do find unethical would be if they had let you make your travel reservations, pay for tickets, travel, etc... then said \"sorry\" and not reimbursed you. Yes, aparents do have many risks in adoption, but being able to trust what your agency says shouldn't be one of them. If your agency says you are chosen, then that should be it. I'm so sorry you were hurt, it shouldn't have happened.  \n",
      "I do agree with you, Jensboys, except that the OP should never have been told to travel and \"come get your daughter\". An agency can be ethical to the bparents and unethical to the aparents or PAPs. If there were such risks, and surely the SW had to have some inkling that there were such risks then she should have told the OP. This was a no-win situation, the agency has damaged the trust of the OP. As I was reading it (and maybe I interpreted what occurred incorrectly), the OP and her DH were told they were chosen and to travel. To say \"come get your daughter\" then revoke that is cruel. Perhaps no ethical line was crossed, but professionalism sure went out the window on this one. I do believe in ethical and fair adoptions and that bparents should be treated honestly, fairly, and ethically, but I also don't believe that aparents should be treated like a commodity and it seems like that is happening a lot these days. I'm wondering too and maybe the OP can shed some light, were they ever invited to speak with the bparents? Is is not possible that after giving them more consideration she may have actually felt more like they could have been her 1st choice? And we also do not know if the agency ever told the bmom that the other couples originally rejected the match. I do think the OP was treated unfairly in this situation.  \n",
      "Welcome Finn! I am so sorry for all the losses that you've had. Your brothers and sister are very lucky to have you! I wish you nothing but the best in your adoption.  \n",
      "Hi Portlowski,Sorry you are going through such a rough time with your DS! He is the pre-k age that I teach, 4-5 yrs. I've seem many children over the years struggle with social relations. I have a couple of suggestions the first being one that you can do at home, in the car, etc... You can present a social scenario to your son, then ask him how he would handle it/what would he say/do, etc.... So let's say that you say, \"you are playing cars with 3 other friends. One wants to build a track, but you don't like that idea. What would you say? What would you do?\" Give him time to reply - some kids need to really process it before they have an idea. Then up the level of frustration a little by saying \"Okay, but what if your friends wants to do it this way instead? What then?\" And keep going. You may have to suggest compromises at first - many kids in this stage have a hard time coming up with multiple compromises. Lay down ground rule(s) for your \"game\": no saying \"I hate you\" (or \"you can't play\") or hitting is where I usually start. Lay out scenarios that seem to re-occur for him or you've witnessed in play then in a future scenario move the location to something like the playground, or swimming pool, or timmy's house, etc... so he can see that while the location changes, the \"what happened\" may be the same or similar. It can be something you work on while driving to somewhere, or while he's taking a bath, or you're folding laundry. Just pick a time when he's not already keyed up or frustrated so he can more clearly think about his responses.The other suggestion that I have is to check with your pediatrician or nearest children's hospital to see if they offer any \"social situations\" classes for his age. Our local children's hospital does as does a speech/hearing center. They are about 30-45 minutes of group play that has an adult facilitating things like conversation, conflict resolution, and emotion managing.I would also find some children's books about emotion managing and read them with him and discuss how he can label what he is feeling and some ways to deal with it (deep breathing, hand clenching/releasing, etc..) One title that I always keep handy is \"When Sophie Gets Really Angry\"Hang in there - I know it's frustrating and makes you really sad and frightened for your child. The first question parents always ask at conference is \"Does my child have any friends?\" Definitely talk to your child's teachers and see how they are helping him manage his emotions and reactions in the classroom. Good luck!  \n",
      "Hi Karen,Sorry you are hurting and feeling down. Our situation is a little different, but there are some parallels. Our DD is 12, will be 13 in January and she's been wanting a sibling for as long as she could understand what a sibling is. She has known about 1 of our miscarriages and found out later about the others. She's been a part of this adoption process since the beginning and has been waiting right alongside of us. I often ask her if it is too \"long\" to wait or if she no longer wants a sibling and if she feels too old and she resoundingly tells me that she will always love and accept her sibling. Then she points out something cool that they can do together. When she was little it was 'I can show him/her my stuffed animals', now it's 'I can babysit!' The good thing is that kids nowadays seem many types of families. Blended families often have age gaps. My own sister and I are 13 years apart and we are the closest of my siblings. I think your daughter will be a wonderful big sister and will be thrilled to have that role no matter what. Hang in there! I hope something opens up for you soon!  \n",
      "Sorry Sunday! It's so hard to be shown and not picked. Our agency just says that a family has been chosen, but not why another family wasn't. I often think that when faced with such a big decision, birthparents may just pick \"something\" in order to give feedback or say why they chose one family over another. It's okay to feel sad, down, and even angry, but hang in there.  \n",
      "Linny, I just watched the youtube audition and WOWZA! She's awesome. She's got my vote! Congrats!  \n",
      "Saya, just curious, would they let you start him when he turns 3 (provided they have space) rather then waiting till the following fall? I would keep him at the daycare that he is happy at to minimize the transitions until you are ready to start him at the preschool. Just my .02  \n",
      "Glad the calls are going better, questioning! I kinda wish our emom wanted more contact, but so far seems happy with a monthly update. May it all go smoothly for you!  \n",

      "I'm so frustrated for you!!! I would seriously think about contacting Dateline or one of the other big national news programs. Negative publicity is one thing many people/businesses/non-profits, etc. don't want, especially if they are doing something wrong. I know you may not feel like fighting anymore, but that is just SO wrong what they have done!Since you may not have the funds to move to another agency, is foster to adopt a possibility for you in your state? Just so sorry that you've had to go through that.  \n",
      "Hi everyone, So we are officially matched with an emom who is due in later January. A.really.long.time.away! The situation seems risky to me, but sometimes you have to take a risk right? I'm hoping for a bit of advice and even some perspective from any birthmoms/amoms who wish to offer it. What has me feeling very anxious is this: she indicated that she wanted to keep in touch during these matched months to get to know one another, however she hasn't responded to the 2 texts I sent her. She had indicated that she would text an update early this week and didn't. I texted after we met that we were happy to meet her and to let her know that she could feel free to contact us either by phone or text when she wanted to talk. I texted this week just to say hi and that I hoped she was feeling well and no response. On one hand I can absolutely understand if she doesn't want contact and we let her know when we met that she could tell us not to contact her if that was her wish. She said that she wanted us to have her number. I know it's a long time until she is due and many things can come up along the way - heck maybe her phone was lost/turned off/broken, etc...I can't speculate on the why, but do I wait for her to contact us or is it okay to send an occasional \"hope you're well\" text? We had really hoped to get to know her beforehand so that if she does place with us, we could have history and stories to tell our child. I can't help but look for red flags to help prepare myself and not get my hopes up. I was planning on calling our SW next week to check in with her and see if she's talked to her. These are certainly strange new waters to navigate!  \n",
      "Thanks all. Got in contact finally! For now everything seems to still be okay. Emom is not sure how much contact she really wants at this time. I can respect that. It makes me nervous, but I'm not sure it's really a red flag. She hasn't asked for any money/expenses yet so no flag there. I get the feeling that she's a very private person and it may be hard having to accept \"strangers\" into her life even if she's the one who's choosing them, kwim? One day at a time, one week at a time until something changes.  \n",
      "Congratulations!!!  \n",
      "Congratulations! Enjoy your new little bundle!  \n",
      "Oceanica, I really feel for your situation. I love Dickons idea of the youtube video, but I would also take it one step further and attach the video to an email letting them know point blank that peanuts or food containing peanuts cannot be eaten or served around your son. Show them his epi pen and let them know that their cavalier attitude towards his allergy shows a lack of respect and acceptance for him. Remind them that they HAVE to read food labels for snacks - especially at the sunday/church school. I would also recommend sending a separate snack for him until they show some responsibility. Good luck - as a teacher I often had to run interference between those parents who just could not understand that because their child wanted peanut butter cookies for birthday snack, why we would not serve them. We made it abundantly clear at the beginning of the year and during monthly newsletters if a food allergy was present, we had to exclude that food from our classroom. I always told parents that it was a wonderful way to teach children to show care and concern for each other when being mindful of food allergies and making sure that a snack was served that everyone could enjoy. Some people get it and some won't.  \n",
      "We also used scrapbook software. Serif has a free download of their digital scrapbook and many free templates. You can also purchase additional templates, but we were just as happy with the free ones. We used a local \"mom & pop\" print shop because they were cheaper than FedEx or Staples. I can appreciate the pressure to use a graphic artist to create your profile. Many couples are our agency did that and it's hard not to feel self-doubt if you choose not to. In the end, I felt like our profile was a good reflection of us.  \n",
      "While I'm not the OP on this, I'm guess the $500 budget is for the graphic designer and printing because were were given a couple of names of designers who many at our agency had worked with and one charged roughly $250 to design a 4 page portfolio and the other charged $300. Then they suggested you print 50 copies on high gloss card or magazine stock and the estimate I got from Fedex was around $5 per piece. The designer does not usually include printing - they give you a print ready PDF or disk. I used the scrapbook softward (free) and an independent small printer (around $40). I know of an agency that has couples submit their pics and writeups to them and they have a standard format that everyone uses and while it made not be \"creative\" or exciting it at least levels the \"playing field\" so to speak!  \n",
      "Congratulations! Enjoys those snuggles!  \n",
      "Congratulations!!!!  \n",

      "I wanted to write earlier, but have just needed this weekend to get my head together. Our meeting with the emom that chose us did not go very well. It was very uncomfortable all around. I had really hoped to connect, but we just didn't. I have no idea where things stand right now. DH and I are just so disappointed and disheartened. Those of you that have adopted in the past, I have so much respect for all the courage you have to get through this. I just don't know if we have that - I'm very resentful of having to jump through hoops. I wish I could say more about the meeting, but can't go into too much detail. E.  \n",
      "Thanks everyone for the kind words. We are okay, disappointed but okay.  \n",
      "We got a \"call\" (I say \"a\" not \"the\" because nothing's matched yet!) this week about a potential match and will get to meet the emom at week's end. I'm so excited and hopeful I could bust and want to tell everyone, yet haven't because I know it could all fall apart at any second. We're trying to stay focused on the meeting, being just plain old us and hoping that we can make a match that will last for the rest of our (hopefully) child's life. There have definitely been moments this weekend where I cannot focus for more than 2 minutes! E.  \n",
      "Wow! Congratulations!!!!! So happy for you!  \n",
      "We did not have any \"red flags\" about our agency until our 2nd information meeting with them. Unfortunately by that time we were already over $5K in. It wasn't an ethics issue, but more of an attitude issue and lack of communication. There is a lack of organization that became very obvious once we were in their offices. Earlier meetings were held offsite to accommodate a larger group. The first meeting talked a lot about loss, grief, the importance of OA and honoring any OA agreements that we enter into. The thing that bothered us later was the constant attitude that we have no standing in this process until we're placed, that the APs are unimportant (the attitude of there are plenty of you waiting so we can treat you however we want). Not being timely with returning calls or emails (just to be clear, I do expect to hear back within 2 business days - I think that's fair. I don't expect a call back in minutes or hours, but 2 days doesn't seem like asking much.)I would say if you feel very strongly about how your prospective agency is treating birthparents then you should walk.  \n",
      "So I just heard from our agency this week that they need more of our profiles - they only have a few left. That means from when I did a re-print in December (we changed some photos and backgrounds) they've gone through about 20 - which in a way is good - we're being shown, but also in a way it feels like \"we're not getting chosen!\":hissy: So I've sent our SW an email asking if she has any input as we update it, but honestly I don't know how much to change. One thing I was thinking about - since I've spent so much time listening to bmoms here on a.com, our agency has always called the intro a \"Dear Birthparent\" letter. I was thinking about changing it to \"Dear Expectant Parent\" any thoughts on that?  \n",
      "If someone tried to start that conversation with me as anti-adoption rhetoric, I would look them in the eye and say \"Two words - Casey Anthony\" Child abuse is awful and horrible no matter who perpetrates it. I think it has absolutely nothing to do with biology, but with the perpetrators own feelings about themself being transferred to the child.  \n",
      "Could you please PM me too? Sorry! I know you're getting a lot of these!  \n",
      "I am so sorry this happened to you! It is definitely not normal and you have every right to express to your agency and the SW (if you are able to finally talk to her) that their behavior has made things 10x harder and frustrating and that you expect in the future, a call if they say they are going to call. Let them know that even if they have to tell you that they don't know anything or can't get ahold of an emom that hearing that is better than silence! I am sorry. I hope that you get some good news soon! <<<<hugs>>>>>  \n",
      "Hi bluebutterfly,I can relate. When we first went \"active\", I would jump whenever the phone rang because I was thinking about it so much. Now, not so much. We've been waiting for 13 months which is not nearly as long as others on this board. I think we all do different things to get through. For awhile, I go on \"autopilot\" blocking out adoption daydreams,etc... Lately, I've been thinking about it more probably because our profile was recently shown and we were not chosen. My best advice is try not to \"overplan\" for baby, but keep doing things you enjoy. Don't put off things like trips/vacation if you can help it. Still do fun couple stuff. I hope your wait isn't too long! When you feel anxious, just hop on here and vent and someone will reach back! :-)  \n",
      "I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be ignorant, but I've heard this reference a couple of times lately. What exactly is the \"baby scoop era?\" My perception/ inference is that it was roughly the 1950-70s where unmarried women were pressured to relinquish, often giving birth and never getting to see/hold their child. Is that correct or is there something else/ another era I missed?  \n",
      "Gwen72My son's birthmom had no insurance and the hospital sent me a bill for almost $5000.00! This was a normal, uncomplicated, old fashioned delivery. Here is a trick I learned though. I happen to work for a hospital based ambulance service so I went to ask our billing ladies if there was anything I could do about this huge expense. They told me to call the hospital where my son was born and talk to their billing office. They said to offer to pay the bill in full if they gave me a good enough discount or I would pay them $100.00 per month for years until it was paid off. I took the billing ladies advice. The hospital offered me 40% off and I payed them right then and there. Good luck with your hospital expenses!Gwen72 - that is awesome that you were able to negotiate the bill down! Our agency told us that we are never allowed to contact the hospital or doctor for an emom bill if that situation arises because of confidentiality and \"the truth is you are nobody in this picture - you have no standing\" (I kid you not!) Furthermore, we are required to pay the entire bill in full within 6 mos. or we can't finalize and to please pay promptly because they don't want to stress an emom with past due bills or calls. That of course would be if we agreed to a match where there was no insurance coverage. I had to stare at the table when she said we were nobody because I was ticked! Good for you being proactive and getting that discount!  \n",
      "Gwen72The agency told you that you were nobody and had no standing in a situation where they expect you to pay several thousand extra dollars in medical bills? Wow! I think you need a new agency if that's how they feel about you. Anyone who talked to me like that would get a 7 1/2 wide combat boot in the rump. Just Sayin'I agree, but we've already put in $7K in fees and we don't want to lose that. She's also made comments before like \"I'm a very outspoken person - you're either going to love me or hate me!\" DH hates her! I'll hate her when it's over! Just kidding, maybe not. It was said in a group lecture so I know it wasn't personal, but it did strike me as rude and could have been worded differently.  \n",
      "I was speaking with a friend today who is also waiting for a match and the subject of \"how it feels when someone we know through our agency is placed\" came up. What really struck me was how I feel versus how I felt when someone I knew through IF circles got pregnant during treatment. Back when we were undergoing treatment when I'd learn that another couple had conceived through treatment I'd feel genuinely happy for them and feel like \"yeah, another success story!\" But now, I just learned that two other couples (whom we only met at our agency classes and don't know personally) have been placed, I feel shock and honestly like I just got punched and the feeling inside is \"why weren't we chosen, what's wrong with us?\" I know I'm overthinking this, but their success feels like our setback (ie not chosen again) where before each couples success at IF treatment wasn't preventing us from realizing our dream, kwim? I hate myself for feeling like this. I'm just wondering if anyone else has felt like this. I really don't like feeling like this and I keep reminding myself that at least it means we'll move up on the list.  \n",
      "Hi Sapo,I've been a preschool teacher for the past 7 years so I thought I've give you my 2 cents. I have to say that if she seems happy there then keep her there. She's doing well and if it's been 5 weeks she's well past the \"honeymoon\" period. I think having that \"space\" from her sibs and letting her be with her peers may be a good thing for her. Good luck!  \n",
      "Wow Just4us, I feel like you could be my twin, our story is so similar! Our DD is 12 and we did include her in our profile and pictures. We are limited to a 4 page profile by our agency and they said to include a lot of pics. We included pics of just DH and I, but also pics of the 3 of us as well as DD with one or the other of us (usually the other was taking the picture!) In all it was about a 50/50 balance. We did include text to say how our next child would also be included in our activities, family etc...We tried to make it clear that a 2nd child is as very much wanted as she. She's a part of our family and to not represent her or downplay her existence feels very wrong to who we are, but also unfair in telling the \"story\" of our family. I've been told by a couple different SWs that some emoms want a childless couple and some are happy with kids. I just have to wonder, do they want their child to always be an \"only\" and if not at some point whoever they placed with would be in that scenario too. I want them to match with us and accept us for who we are and DD is a big part of that.  \n",
      "Ouch! Fingerprints done at our local Action for Children office cost $50 and they included the FBI and BCI (Ohio required) and results were sent directly to our agency who received them in like 3 days. We weren't given anything on paper except a receipt. Sorry you have to have them redone already!  \n",
      "While we haven't been matched yet, we have been asked if we wanted our profile shared with Emoms that had special circumstances. Our agency uses a form and it contains basic information such as EDD, any U/S results, age, race, drug/alcohol/prescription drug use, basic family medical history (i.e. cancer in family, heart disease, etc.) We were told if the EDad was informed of the pregnancy or not. I guess it's hard to have an \"open\" adoption if the info doesn't flow both ways kwim? I don't think it's too much to ask for basic medical info so that PAPs can make their best informed decision about whether a match would work. I wouldn't want to accept a match then decline it. PAPs have to give out a lot of personal info including pictures, family info, etc.... I can't say that I feel exactly thrilled to have pictures of me, dh, our dd, our home, etc..... out there, but that's how it is. If an emom didn't want to meet us in person and placed with us, we would never even know what she looked like. I just wish there could be fairness for all. I do have to vent just a sec and say that this process has been very hard for us. As IF patients we were always treated with the utmost care and respect, especially for our privacy and emotions. It wasn't fun or easy, but I felt treated like a person who mattered. During the homestudy process, we were kept waiting several times for appointments (+1 1/2 hrs), calls don't always get returned quickly, and we were told upfront Emoms always come first. Our agency even uses leftover PAP profiles as \"examples\" for the new PAP families coming in to orientation.So how do we - all triad members - come to a consensus for what is shareable?  \n",
      "Could you PM me as well with your experience? We are looking at them as well? Thanks!  \n",
      "Good luck! Good luck! So exciting and so understandably hard to wait!  \n",
      "Hi! I'm Erin and we have been officially waiting since July 2010. We have not yet been matched, but I know that our profile has been shown at least 4 times. It can sting knowing that someone passed over you, but I remind myself that it can be something so random that makes someone stop and take a second look that there's no reason to take it personally. We have a bit of a unique situation that might or might not be affecting an expectant mother's decision - DH and I have a 12 yr. old biological child that we were blessed with after IF treatment. We are also in Ohio and using a local agency. Good luck to everyone waiting!  \n",
      "Hi! I was wondering if anyone has any experience with using ParentGallery.com? While we hope to get listed on ParentProfiles too, I found Parent Gallery which is free. PM me , if needed. I just can't find any reviews either way about this site. Thanks! E.  \n",
      "My DH and I started the process slightly over a year ago now. Our homestudy was approved in early July 2010. Since then, several couples from our initial group have been matched/placed and unfortunately we still are waiting. Every day, it gets harder to believe that we will be matched. I know that is not logical and I don't want to give in to such pessimism. Our agency gave us so many anecdotal stories of quick matches - none taking longer than 9 months (red flag?) that now we feel very down, as if something is wrong with us. I know other couples are waiting too some even longer. I guess my biggest question, especially for those whose matches took longer to come, how do you wait and keep hopeful? At what point do you start questioning your agency to make sure you haven't been misplaced/misfiled/forgotten?  \n",
      "Thank you everyone for your thoughts and sharing your experiences. It does help hearing that we are not alone as we take this journey. DH and I traveled the road of infertility for 15 years. That was a well worn path and one that through experience we learned to navigate. Adoption is still very new for us and I admit, we are very naive to have believed in too quickly all the \"fast\" matches that were paraded before us. That being said, we are at a crossroads of sorts. We had hoped to be able to adopt twice. We are in a newborn program (our criteria is pretty open, but our agency has at least 30 waiting families right now...not good odds for us). Just recently we saw a profile of a foster child who is a grade schooler and are now very confused because we would like to find out more about her situation. We don't know which step to take next (I know, only we can make that decision!), but are really confused who to contact first. Do we contact the little girl's SW to find out more about her then approach our agency? Or do we talk to them first? We are thinking that we could adopt twice. We'd like to still be considered for an infant placement knowing our wait may be long, but I don't want to make this little girl wait. I think we should inquire about her situation with her SW first, than if it's a situation that is right for us and her, move forward and check with our agency to see if that boots us out of their program.  \n",
      "I know many threads deal with the adoption tax credit so I apologize if my question is a repeat. We began the adoption process in January of 2010 and were officially approved and waiting by July 2010. We have paid approximately $7500 in fees to our agency thus far. We had hoped that this year, 2011 we might be placed and then would file for the tax credit. It sounds like we've missed the boat though and could have filed for credit for the initial $7500 even though we haven't been placed yet. Is that correct? Two people who I spoke with indicated that we could only claim the credit if we actually got placed which is why we've done nothing with it this year. Any insight would be appreciated!  \n",

I added the XXXX's:[/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]\"Full Caucasian Baby XXXXXX due XXXXX 3 rd in XXXXX Expectant mom is Caucasian, 26 yrs old, blue eyes and brown hair. This is her 9th pregnancy. She is parenting her first child, she has had 1 miscarriage and she has placed the last 6 children for adoption. She notes the pregnancy to be a surprise and that she and her husband are not in a position to support any additional children. She is receiving prenatal care and will be covered under Medicaid. She denies the use of drugs, alcohol or smoking with this pregnancy. The expectant mom has placenta previa and has delivered early in the past. It is expectant she will deliver early with this pregnancy as well. The babies have been born early and all have been healthy with no concerns. There are no mental concerns. The expectant father is 29 yrs old, Caucasian, blue eyes and brown hair. He is married to the expectant mom and they are still in a relationship. He is the biological father to all of her children to include the last 6 children they placed for adoption together. The expectant father notes he does smoke a pack of cigarettes per day but denies any drug or alcohol use. There are no mental concerns. He supports this adoption plan and will sign consents for placement.  The expectant couple would like a Married Traditional family with less than 2 children. They would like the family to be (of the) XXXXX (faith). They are not open to a family of XXXXXX faith. They would like the family to be open to contact during the pregnancy and meeting with them prior to placement. After placement a semi-open adoption with pictures and letters thru the agency until the child is 18 yrs old. This couple has placed their other children through this same agency and while the agency notes this couple may be a little difficult at times, they always place without hesitation. An adoptive family should be aware of this going into this situation. The fees associated with this opportunity are $42,500 for everything except travel to XXXXXX. The expectant couple is asking to view profiles and speak with adoptive families prior to a match consideration.\"[/FONT] [FONT=Times New Roman]I know I am totally assuming alot when I read this and will surely be flamed, but this situation seems like a baby mill with months of expenses being paid and an agency that is willing to support it.[/FONT] [FONT=Times New Roman]Without even going into the motives behind the eparents, what is up with the agency? I know someone has to place this baby, but if you keep helping a couple 7 TIMES get months and months of living expenses, why would they not place more babies? And the fact that they acknowledge they are hard to work with? So you mean they ask for more and more financial help or do they take the acouple on an emotional rollercoaster but always place in the end? Why not have the couple contact you (the agency) a month before the due date and match a couple with them then? If they are not doing it for the money and always place, don't let them jerk someone around like that. [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]And why are the fees so high? No extra work is being gone to track down a bfather (or five possible bfathers) or medical bills to pay. She's surely got plenty of maturnity clothes. Since this is posted through an outsourced facilitator, the afamilies are contacting the agency, are not paying the agency to be \"marketed\" and have to pay the facilitator fees on top of the fee listed. (Why doesn't the agency pay it?)[/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]I FEEL like I am looking at a classified ad for a BABY and can have it for the bargain price of $43K plus travel. [/FONT] [FONT=Times New Roman]My SW told me a local AZ agency called one of her clients and said there was a baby born and was he was biracial, which was a \"surprise\". The pospective aparents that were at the hospital wanted a CC baby and did not want the baby. The agency knew this family had adopted a biracial baby through then before. The fees were $30K. Did they want the baby? They called their SW and asked her OPINION and she said, \"I would pass. Sounds like you are buying a baby to me.\" It's like the agency was hell bent on making their money off this situation. [/FONT] [FONT=Times New Roman]Or why are fees $25K for a \"situation\" when a bmom decides in the hospital she wants to place, has never contacted an agency before, and the hospital staff calls an agency they know. There was NO \"work\" taking care of the emom and afamily over the past few months. I get there was networking done so the hospital knew to call them, but it was LUCK! And they want to charge thier clients FULL price! AAAGH![/FONT] [FONT=Times New Roman]I guess it's time for me to figure out how to create a \"national\" agency that pays it's employees for the hard work they do working with emoms and afamilies, pays for advertising to get the name out there, but does not rock the aparents financially in the process. :( [/FONT]  [FONT=Times New Roman]Thanks for letting me vent, ramble, etc. Can you tell I'm thinking about child #5/adoption #3 and am irritated as to some of the options out there?[/FONT]  \n",

      "As the mom of four and having traveled/stayed in hotels with little ones with routines - my STRONG suggestion is stay as close to home as possible. Let your DH and son sleep at home and get good sleep. If not, DS may wake new baby and vice versa. You will all do better. =) As long as you are near medical care, don't worry about being near where your little one is born. Most the time it's never the pediatrician that checked the baby out in the hospital that will see him/her again if there is a problem.  Best of luck!  \n",
      "My little ones are 5 1/2 months apart. DS was through an agency and DD was private. Our in state SW was totally supportive of the idea when we brought it up. I was sure she would say she wouldn't ok it or give us her opinion we shouldn't. Bmom of both kiddos had no problem with it.  As the mom, I love it! Figured if I was doing all the stages, I might as well do it at the same time! Older DD's love them to death and are big helpers. People call them the twins, I never have. I just call them \"the babies\"!  \n",
      "Agency w/ DS mailed us all that info when we matched. They were out of state, so they had nothing to do with post placement visits. The company that did TPR and ICPC and had more to do with the ok to start finalization. They ok'd our AZ SW to start visits two months after he was born. CA required 4 visits, all at least a month apart. It was ridiculous by the end. SW even made fun of it! Did not finalize until he was 11 months, and nobady was fighting anything.  Push to get a visit scheduled. Remember it's summer, which usually means vacation time, etc and they may be behind. But I don't think they'll get mad at you for being anxious to get the ball rolling.  Good Luck!  \n",
      "I'm not sure why, but I've been nervous to ask this. Just don't want someone to flame me for being uneducated, etc. So if I am, please be gentle. =) For those who adopted a baby that is a race other than their own, did you name the baby a name that you had on your list of favorites or did you feel the need/desire to name your little one something that was similiar to names of their race? Or a combination of the two? (This includes domestic adoptions.) Thanks!  \n",
      "We have two biological daughters and our DS and DD are adopted. DS was our first adoption and we used an agency in CA. (We are in AZ.) DD was a private adoption. Bmom was a former employee of mine and called me. We went through the county for the legal part. Very easy. Currently we are looking at different situations with facilitators. Not really wanting another newborn with just getting out of it with an 18 and 12 month old right now. Maybe a private adoption of a toddler or infant. But then I say information about a emom who is Armenian, and DD is 1/2 Armenian and that sounded interesting, as so few are placed for adoption. So, who knows how it will turn out. I'm driving husband crazy with all my plans! =)  \n",
      "DS's bmom used meth til 5th month. No effects at birth or since. (Had unrelated infection that let to a week in NICU.) DD's bmom used meth on and off the whole pregnancy. Nurses were sure she was going through withdrawl during labor. Test on DD at 48 hours was negative, but Bmom told me later she used it close to delivery. Only kept her to wait for test results. No effects then or now. As far as rent, do not have your attorney just send it to her. Have your attorney make the check out to the apartment building (or where ever she is.) I paid for DD's bmoms rent the last few months (or she would have been kicked out and in a worse situation) and I made the check out to the complex. If they want a money order, then get that. No idea why your attorney would not tell you that. Same for any utilities, etc if necessary. (Food you can do gift cards, but if someone is really desperate to use the money for something else, they won't hesitate to sell it for half the value.)  PM me if you have any other questions about living expenses, etc. =)  \n",
      "Next time she does what an earache DEMAND the drops. Tell your ped you understand she will still need to come in the next day and get checked out and get antibiotics, BUT from the middle of the night screaming until you can get her in you need the drops to calm your child. Hold firm. Request then demand. They are called A/B Otic Drops. I understand people will use these just like people use pain meds and ignore they need to see the dr, but a screaming baby in pain doean's care what time it is or that they will see a dr in the AM. I think parents should be given them ahead of time personally.  BTW-Just did the 2-4 AM Urgent Care visit this past week for swimmers ear cuz me 8 year old was FREAKING OUT. She has never had an ear infection and the drops are the only thing that helped. I put the homeopathic ones in and they did not help her. JMO  \n",
      "I was told this morning that my business partner's 13 day old baby girl, Melody June, passed away last night. She was not expected to live past a few moments at birth. (She had a hole in her heart and surgery at birth is not an option.) She lived almost two weeks. I got to meet her on Tuesday. She was at home since birth and a beautiful little angel. They have alot of family, church and friend support. So I know food, childcare for their 7 and 4 year olds, and cleaning is taken care of. What can I do to show my love and support? What made a difference for you (or a family member if they lost a newborn)? Did someone do something unexpected/special that helped? Besides sending flowers, I feel useless. =( Thank you, Jolleen  \n",
      "Thank you for your thoughtful replies. The dad is my partner, but we are all friends. Yesterday was pretty rough. He would send me texts about wanting to hold his baby and hoping an account pays on Monday as planned so he can pay for the funeral. =( I cried all day.  I asked my brother's wife (he is our other partner) to make matching bracelets for Mom, the two little sisters and the baby. He took them over today. (I couldn't get a sitter.) I love the idea of the tree too. A June/July blooming tree is perfect. She passed away in June and it is her middle name too.  I'll keep your advice in mind to let them talk and share and not give all the remarks that irritate them like \"She's in a better place\" or \"You are still young. You can have more.\"  Ladies, thanks for being their for me! Jolleen  \n",
      "DS's bmom was 29 and bdad was 36. Both were seperated from other people. At the time, she had a 10 year old son and 6 year old daugher from another relationship. Both lived with their dad/grandma. Bdad has no other kids. DD's bmom was 28 and bdad 29. They were dating when she got pregnant. She's never been married. He has been seperated from his wife for years. She has had seven other children before my daughter. She does not have custody of any of them. Two in foster (now adopted), one in Mexico, two with extended family (now adopted) and two with their dad's extended family. (The last two I mentioned don't know they are (full) sibilings, that they are adopted, that their \"cousins\" bmom is their bmom or their other \"cousins\" are their half siblings. They are the only two with the same dad.) Bdad has one daughter with his wife that was 5 and she supposedly lives with her mom and his parents in Australia. My bio kids are trying to figure out how many \"brothers and sisters\" they have through all this! ;) Aren't kids awesome!  \n",
      "(Looking for info by PM) I live in AZ and we did our homestudy with a SW/Company out of Phx. I LOVE her and she has been amazing the past two years. BUT, it takes five months to get certified with her, which when I started with her I thought that much be the norm. But looking back I think it is because she spaced our home and personal interviews out a month each time. We got our packet in May and did our first visit 4th of July. Get certified in Oct. I know she is very on top of things so it's not that things are sitting there. I think it is because she works part-time and has LOTS of clients, so those are her first available times. We're happy to stay with her for re-cert, etc. SO, our friends are looking to start the process and I am hoping someone can recommend (BY PM) a great SW to do their homestudy that works quickly. It seems someone that is from SW Arizona has in her signature on this board that their start and certified date were MUCH quicker than mine, but they live too far from us. Thanks in advance. We are having dinner with them this week and I'd love to have some info to share about this part. Remember to PM me the info. =) :thanks:  \n",
      "Where is the social worker in all this? There should be guardianship papers signed in front of the hospital social worker that gives you permission to the babies medical records and get medical treatment. Make sure he/she is present in the meeting.  If they are not educated you need to PUSH to educate them. Do not let their ignorance excuse them. Best of luck.  \n",

      "I would say,  \"We think of you all the time and keep meaning to write you. But the times we stop to write you we've only have a few minutes. We know there is so much to share and don't want to skip over the details, that we keep waiting for a bigger block of time to tell you all about how XX is doing. We've figured out that the big block of time as never going to magically appear and we've just got to start writing! So here we go... Good luck! BTW, I tend to wait to call my children's bmoms when I know I have an hour to talk even though I think of them often. Then months have passed and I have never had that hour and just call!  \n",

      "One of the questions on the physical form your Dr. must fill out is if any of your emotional/physical situations would prevent you from caring for a child. I would make an appointment with your primary care dr who will have to do the physical and ask him/her if they would say yes.  If it is yes, which I can only image it would be since you already care for your son, make an appointment with the person you will have do your homestudy and at the appt tell you your mental history, what the dr said and ask her based on the info you are giving her (any if everything thing else checks out ok) if he/she feels he/she would submit it for approval.  If your homestudy is approved, can't see an agency not working with you. And remember, you will have to be chosen by a birthmother is comfortable with your situation.  Best of luck. Your situation sounds very close to my sister, and she is listed as the person who would get my four children if anything were to happen to my husband and I. I commend you for being so diligent in your care.  \n",
      "When my grandparents divorced, my father and his brother was sent up to live with his sister when he was in high school and brother was 5 years younger.  It was on a farm in Montana. His sister and brother-in-law had nine children, from Jr High age to newborn. He and his brother were used as \"slaves\" and spent all their time working on the farm, cleaning the house, washing out the cloth diapers for all the babies, and given very little food. My dad gave as much of his food as he could to his brother.  My father was beaten severely by his brother in law and finally ran away so he could go to school. He finished his last two years of high school living in parked cars, sneaking into the school at night and showing in the gym and staying on friends' couches when possible. I know this wasn't adoption, but sounds the same, when people pretend they are going to care for children so they can use them for labor.  Make me sick to my stomach when I think about it.  \n",
      "If you are adopting a toddler, you won't have to do the newborn no sleep months which is what hits me hard physically! =) Two of my girls I had in my early twenties and now in the early thirties I have two infants. I think parenting gets easier the older I get. Life is more settled down, I've \"figured\" out who I am, I'm settled in my roles with my in-laws, I don't take the little things as seriously and have more life experience to base decisions off of. Go for it if you want to parent. You sound like you will make an amazing mom!  \n",
      "I do not vaccinate my children. SW asked on post placement visits if they were up to date. I told her we do not vaccinate. She said ok and noted it on the health info. Never was an issue with either state or our agency. It's your choice.  \n",
      "My mom works from my home and when we were doing our homestudy slept over two nights a week. She was fingerprinted, was listed on the CPS form, and met for a moment with our SW. No big deal for us.  \n",
      "I was at my brother's 30th birthday party tonight and ended talking with a family friend. We updated each other on our children and she mentioned her cousin had recently announced to her family she was going to place her baby (that is due this summer) for adoption. My friend asked if we were looking to adopt more children and said she loved the idea of being able to see the child grow up over the years. (Her parents live near me.) She said she would see where her cousin was at with deciding, counseling, matching , etc and see if she was interested in emailing us.  Our DS was matched through a private agency in CA. He was born in CA and the adoption was finalized there. We live in AZ and DD was born here and all paperwork was done through our county attornies' office.  So, if this is meant to be (and I'm not holding my breath), how would we do this? Anyone familiar with NV laws since the baby would be born there? I saw a website that said out-of-state families can not finalize there. I know I would have to get an attorney here, someone there to do ICPS, but what else. (Our homestudy was just renewed.) A weird tid bit - Emom lives in Las Vegas and is named L. DS's bmom was raised in Vegas and was living there when she contacted our agency and lives there now. And our DD's bmom's name is L. Just interesting. =) (I told my friend that if L is not interested in talking with us as a possible match, I told her I would be happy to talk with her about the agency we went through with DS or answer any and all questions she has about the process.) Thanks in advance!  \n",
      "If you take your child/children with you to the hospital, they \"are\" siblings. They are welcomed* in to the maternity floor to visit and take pictures, just like if you had given birth to a baby. (*If bmom wants them to visit, of course.)  \n",
      "Our DS's bmom had it and our DS actually got GBS. He was born at 10pm and during one of the night checks his temp was down. They took him to the nursery and he had to be under the lamps to keep temp up, get an IV for antibiotics, had high respitory rate, etc. He had an EKG and the spinal test for menengitis. (sp?) Both were negative. He spent a few days there then ws transported to big hospital by ambulance to finish out the weeks worth of antibiotics in the NICU. DD had a low temp an hour after birth, so she spent the first few hours in the nursery. They kept her the three days and test came back negative. So it is highly unlikely anything will happen, but something could still pass even with the doses of antibiotics. Dr's said low temp is a big sign of infection, so watch for that.  Best of luck!  \n",
      "I have two biological daughters. I have an two children through adoption. I ache to be pregnant again.  My first C-section left me with a terrible infection/scarring that they discovered during my second C-section. The doctor told me during my follow up visit that it was a miracle that my uterus did not tear open before the C-section. He told me I could possibly carry a baby without any problems in the future, or I could have one good contraction that could end up with the baby and/or myself not surviving. It was devistating. I think it was worse that I was supposed to make the decision to get pregnant again or not. I wasn't just told, \"don't get pregnant again\".  I waited for six years and decided to continue having babies through adoption. While we were waiting I had three relatives that got pregnant (one was on the verge of a divorce, the next was upset she was pregnant again and the other was with an on again/ off again girlfriend.) I was upset, angry and hurt. Why were they getting babies?  I would walk the mall and see the young pregnant girls and wonder if they had the means and family support to raise the child. I wondered if they knew about the option of adoption. I cried at night and just wanted to be prenant again.  And now with 10 and 8 year olds. a 17 month old and 11 month old to take care of, I still feel that way. I know I can adopt more children if we decide to, but I am basically angry that I didn't get to choose to chose to not experience pregnancy again. I had a dream just last night about being pregnant. Here's the crazy part. I can get pregnant. It may not be safe to be pregnant. We've clearly decided no more pregnancies due to the potential danger. (And I know I could be totally fine. I just could not stand knowing I left my other children if something did happen because I wanted my way.) So my husband sets up a an appointent to have a vasectomy. The night before the surgery I was freaked out and did not want him to go. Because it made it final. We'd already chosen that it was final, but now it's final, final. =) (He did go by the way.) I'm just running on now because even in my family I don't think any of my siblings can really understand how I feel. And this is place of amazing woman that I think actually have experienced my rollercoaster of emotions. =) So, thanks to everyone for sharing your honest opinions, fears, dreams, and actions. So many posts have helped me accept myself and my feelings over the past two years.  Hugs from AZ  \n",
      "We had to have four with DS. CA required her to ask the same questions everytime. She was embarrased the third and fourth time to ask formula type, AGAIN! Asked for new things DS was doing. Just make a little list to help you remember what had happened since last visit, esp if you have alot of visits to do. =) (Like smiling, babbling, follows an object, holds bottle himself, rolls over, laughs, responds to name, bats at mobile, etc.)  Asks for height and weight, number of bottles a day, ounces per bottle.  How you and DH are adjusting, how your kids are adjusting. any changes in relationships (We joked that we sleep on different sides of the house now and get no sleep!) Updated her on Bmom contact and how she was adjusting. (Don't think this was a required question. Just chatted about it cuz she knew our story.) We held, fed and changed DS there. SW is just collecting info to fill in the post placement report. Funny story (well now it is.) We got our DD when DS was 5 months. When DD was about 5 months I was out running errands. SW called and asked where I was. Told her I was out running errands with the babies. She wondered when I'd be home cuz she was there for our last visit! I started laughing hysterically cuz I had it for a month later on my calendar. We always did them on Fridays so my DS could be there. This was a Tues! Besides the babies, we have a 7 and 9 year olds and the living room was piled full of folded laundry and then all the regular dishes in the kitchen, etc. I told her my house was a mess and husband was at work. Told her I was sure appt was a month later. She said she did not care, that it was then or we could not finalize on Adoption Day on Nov! I said ok, but be prepared. I took her right into the den, which is right inside the front door and we visited in there. DS was about 10 months and trying out his new teeth. She was wearing shorts and he bit her right on her knee! I turned to DS and said \"Don't do that! She might change her mind!\" She laughed and said there was no way she would!  Needless to day, they are painless visits and fun for them to see what your new one looks like and see how they grow.  DON'T STRESS AT ALL ABOUT THEM! Once I saw how cauaul they were, I was happy to meet with her showered and stopped putting on make-up! =)  \n",
      "Siblings of newborns can go in the labor/delivery/recovery floor. Your children absolutely can be there for visits. It is your choice if they go or not.  My girls went to CA with us for DS's birth and MIL came to watch them during hospital time. They visited with bmom pre and post birth and had pics with DS. DD was born an hour away, so they were brought out each day by MIL. Even my infant DS can for the first visit. I have awesome pics of all four on the bed laying together. I would bring him if you have someone to be with him until baby is discharged. They will discharge the baby to you. Bmom will sign forms with the hospital socialworker that give guardianship to you so you can get medical care, get medical records and do the actual discharge. Make sure you ask and get the FULL discharge report from the hospital. Take it to first peds appt when you get back home. =) Best of luck!  \n",
      "If you want the info just for you and bdad, and not the courts I would recommend [URL=\"https://www.gtldna.net\"]https://www.gtldna.net[/URL]. We used it for my DD. Ruled out bdad that signed TPR and then requested one. Used it again to confirm actual bdad. It is cheap, fast and can be done out of state. Since you won't be with him, I would have bmom be there with him. You'll be taking their word that he did it either way since you can't take the cotton swab from his hand. =) But he can do it, mail it to you and you'll mail it in with your daughters. Thank heavens for this test. Otherwise a man would have signed TPR that wasn't his daughter and we would have had an open relationship with him, his other kids, his mom and sister. And we would not know she is not half German but actually half Arminian! HTH!  \n",
      "DS started doing this and it he needed to burp. It's when we introduced new or more solid foods. If I went in, picked him up and burped him, then layed him back down he was out again for the night.  Just another idea!  \n",
      "No. It's to make sure the family would be ok in case something happened to you or your husband.  \n",
      "We put yes with our DS. Bmom kept saying she thought it was because she was measuring big and dr. said it was possible. (Ended up just carrying lots of extra fluid.) Never asked to consider a situation. DD's bmom was a previous employee of mine and contacted us outside of an agency. We have four children now and IF we consider another newborn adoption I would take twins. Our little ones are five months apart. =) I have tons of family and possible help. I also have neices that are twins! More for me the questions is: Do I want to do newborn duty again and have my kids ten+ years apart? We are considering fost/adopt if we decide to adopt again.  \n",
      "I'm not trying to start a debate, but I think it would be tough to explain to child that their bmom got pregnant with them so she could place the child with another family. I understand it as an adult and amom. But as the adoptee, even with dad being \"both\" dads, I think that would be tough to deal with emotionally. I'm in support of surrogacy (before my uterus gave out from a bad c-section) I always thought I would do that for a sibling if they needed it, using their egg and sperm. (My sister cannot carry a child due to back problems.) I have 2 bio children and 2 adopted children and think I could carry a child that was not mine biologically and be ok with the \"genetic\" parents raising the baby. I could be around and babysit my neice or nephew and have a special bond, but not feel like it was \"my\" child living with them. I could NOT if the egg was mine.  So, as far as your question, I would just hang on to what you have in the works. I remember being \"live\" with our agency for week and being sure it was never going to happen. I put in a call to the state fost/adopt agency and started researching it. (Our girls were 5 and 7 and I felt like we would never get chosen because of it. ) A week and a half after being going \"live\" we matched with our son, who was due in 3 months.  Lots of hugs and love for all of you who are waiting.  \n",
      "I'm so sorry for your pain.  In CA, the TPR paperwork Bmom signed said if our DS did not go to us she had the right to chose new aparents. The state paperwork says she was signing the papers based on the placement was with us. I think you are in a tricky place. Have you had all your post placement visits? (We had to have four for CA.) I would do what it takes for you two to be safe, then start asking questions about your options next. Just wondering, did he ever have any of this behavior before? Is this behavior totally out of character? Was he verbally or emotionally abusive before or what you can see now was controlling?  \n",
      "Our agency with our DS let you specify, but like they said, alot of the emom's have not had ultrasounds and don't know until after the match what the gender is. That would make you not eligible to match with all those emoms. Our DD we matched early in the pregnancy (she was a former employee of mine) so we had no idea about gender. You do what your heart says to do. Our DS's bmom chose with another couple first, but they could not afford the extra living expenses she required. If that had not happened she would never had seen our profile and our DS would not be ours! It's a rollercoaster of a journey, but one I'd never trade it!  \n",
      "The later they come in the \"better\" as there is less bottle time in the teeth. The later they come in the later they come out, which is \"better\" because they are older and usually take better care of them. (My husband is a dentist. This is what he was taught.) DD is 10 months and no teeth in sight, yet she has drooled like a water fall for six months!  DS is 15 months and has a full mouth of teeth, and got his first one at four month. No rhyme or reason to it =)  \n",
      "Do you go to a Chiropractor? My neice would only crawled in circles. They took her to their Chiropractor and he said her hip was out. After the adjustment they set her down and she crawled straight across the room and never stopped! Maybe there is some type of pressure on her low back or hips that make it so she doesn't want to go in that position. It may be easy to solve in a visit or two at her age. Good luck!  \n",
      "I guess every agency does it different. Ours posts all of them online, so everyone is available if the emom has internet access. If she does not, they send ten profiles at a time that they think best fit what she says she is looking for. If she does not pick any of them, they send out another set. We had been \"live\" for a week when our DS's bmom picked us. We were actually her second pick, as the first couple could not provide the extra living exprenses she required. We were in her second batch. She was very thankful after they did not match that she got to see us. She had decided in her head a couple without kids and we have two bio kids. She said when she saw our profile she knew we were the ones and cried for 2 hours. What a blessing for us. We can't image our DS not being ours!  \n",
      "We could not work with the agency the church we were raised in runs. We have not participated in several years. It is also a free service, but takes years for placement. We we're up for the wait. We worked with a non religious private agency with our DS. We are agnostic. We listed ourselves as Spiritual. That's what I consider myself. =) We talked about our religious upbringing during the match call and during visits. Also why our views had changed from what we were taught. She loved our more accepting point of view of people and their choices, as it she fell into that category in her choices to that point.  Our DD was private and religion was never brought up during match talks. Bmom was not raised in any particular church and suspected bdad was Pagan. He liked that we didn't have strong religious ties. He didn't end up being bdad. Actual bdad is never brought it up in the two visits we did have. I thought religion it would play a much greater role in our adoptions than it did. It played very little, if any.  \n",
      "Our DS was born 15 months ago in CA. He had an infection and spent 8 days in the NICU. Bmom could not sign TRP until after he was discharged. I believe it was the agency that handled the TRP and ICPC's rule. (They had a baby where bparents signed TPR's, then medical issues arose while baby was still in the hospital and the aparents backed out. The agency was then the legal guardian of the baby and won't do TPR now until the baby is released.) Once TPR was filed with the State of CA for us, the ICPC process started. (My dh had to fly back home and our sons sweet bmom bunked with me at the hotel for that week. It was an emotional rollercoaster, but I never doubted for a moment her commitment to the adoption. It was hard on her too, as she could feel herself bonding with him more and more each day. We also were not allowed there from 6-7 am and 6-7 pm while they did shift changes.) So, ask your agency their rules and the state's rules about TPR. And like previous posts stated, check insurance rules, medical info, local housing, etc. Best of luck!!!!  \n",
      "Do you only see emom at the dr. visits? Do you talk on the phone or got out for lunch? Can't you talk to her directly and ask her if you have upset her?  Not pretending to be the Know It All. I know that other adoptions will not be like my two, but I honestly would be concerned. Mostly at the behavior of your agency. I can not imagine our agency saying that to us. I think my counselor would have been brutally honest with me if she thought something was up and worked through the issue with the emom to give me as much info as she could. We got very close to our first bmom, the agency saw that is what she needed to be able to place, and NEVER pushed us to scale back on the relationship.  I also think it is bogus that you do not get full updates on the prenatal visits. Our agreement with our agency was a phone call from them after a visit and any and all info we needed. I never needed them because we were there or she would call us with every detail. (Emoms agree to this when they decide to work with the agency.) Especially when there are possible immediate and long term issues! For ME, red flags! Like I said, could be so many reasons why emom is doing this, but why isn't the agency finding out and updating you. =(  AND, like I started this, can't you visit with her and talk with her?  \n",
      "My husband and I have two bio children-both girls. They are 9.5 and 7.5. Our little ones are both adopted. DS is 14 months and DD is 9 months!  \n",
      "I'm just posting in regards to your statement that you are just the amom and emom doesn't ask alot of questions. I went to several prenatal visits with both of my little ones. I would wait to see if bmoms asked the questions I wanted to ask, and if they didn't I asked away. The doctors/nurses answered away without hesitation. I even asked questions bmoms memtioned they wanted to ask before the visit and had forgotten/too afraid to ask. They both appreciated my asking all the questions and making the most off all of the visits. I would have done the same thing if my sister or best friends were getting information and were'nt asking questions. If I had questions between visits I'd call and tell them I was amom and XXX was happening, what should we do. They were always great! So jump in. I'm betting emom will appreciate someone taking care of it for her and looking out for her and baby! Hugs!!!  \n",
      "We just got home from our DD's Finalization Hearing! (She's almost 7 months.) What a fabulous day! About fourty family members came and squeezed in the tiny court room! We enjoyed all the activities for AZ's National Adoption Day. (Over 200 children had their hearing's today!)  We all went out to an italian restaurant and when we drove home all I could say was \"This was a good day!\". DS's Finalization (he'll be 1 on Monday) was in CA on Oct 9 and only four family members could be there. Made today a joint celebration for both of them. Our DD's (7 and 9) were beaming the whole time! Just wanted to share and thank all of you for your support, courage and love this past year. I didn't post a ton, but I learned SO much from reading all of your posts. Especially all the brutally honest ones about yourselves that made me feel \"normal\" again. THANK YOU!  Jolleen  \n",
      "We had two bio girls when we signed with our agency. That was my concern too. Our DS's Bmom told us later she was planning on a couple without kids, but when she read our profile she knew we were the ones and none of that mattered. Our DD's bmom knew our son was arriving in a a month and she wasn't due for 6 more and wanted to match with us. So, when you are the one, you are the one!  IMO, as far as a boy, only thing that would make it slower is that many of the Bmoms have not had ultrasounds, so they don't know what they are going to have, which makes them pick a family that is open to either.  Welcome! (BTW, we had our profile in for a week and I was already ready to give up! Three days later we matched!)  \n",
      "I was at the bank today with my two little ones. They are 5 months apart, so it's obvious I did not give birth to both of them. =) The teller asked their ages, if they were both mine and I sometimes leave them with the answers to those and no more info (and their confused look) and sometimes smile and say \"They are both adopted!\". I told her they were adopted and she said \"Oh! They are so lucky. I mean you hear about all those horrible things that happen to the kids that go to foster care.\" I truly thought of this thread and said, \"Well, we are the lucky ones! And as far as them being the lucky ones, we'll wait to see what they say about us when they are grown up! =)\" It was great!  \n",

Towards the end of the pregnancy she told her family and after moving back home she told her son. She will tell her daughter when she is a little older.  DD's mom has seven other children that are in fostercare or living with family. The oldest is 11. She hid it from them the wholetime. After DD was placed she told the older ones. I got to meet them all when my DD was 3 months old. Everyone has their own way of dealing with placing their child and of dealing with their family. If she knows she is strong enough to place but not deal with her family's drama, let her work it out.  JMTC  \n",

      "If you and the birthparents all live in Maricopa County and it is a non-contested adoption and birth father will sign TPR, you do not need legal represention or an independent attorney on retainer. You only need the Maricopa County Attorneys Office (They are free).  We filled out a very basic application with them (MCAO) after we \"matched\". They gave me the paperwork for emom to sign and notarize about living expenses we paid that had to be filed with the court. And 72 hours after DD was born they gave me the paperwork the birthparents needed to sign. Bparents had to sign it in front of a notary and I turned them back in!  (We did have a bfather switch-a-roo and were potentially needing an attorney for a John Doe Term. Once we found actual Bfather on our own through bmom and he passed DNA and signed TPR we started it up again with the County.) We finalize on National Adoption Day and have not paid the County anything, not even filing fees. I have an awesome agency that did our homestudy and post placement visits for both our little ones. They also have a free book for their clients to put their profile in for birthmothers that approach them to look at. (They do not do heavy marketing like the big agencies. They are listed in the yellow pages under adoption services so they have emoms contact them for counseling, etc.) If you are chosen, they introduce you to each other and you take it from there. I wish you the best of luck. PM me if you want the contact info for our AWESOME homestudy agency. =)  \n",
      "Our DD was a 5 days old and the TPR was done with Bmom and Bdad 72 hours after birth. They were submitted to the county attorney and the ball was rolling. Bdad called and said he was not 100% sure he was the dad and wanted a DNA test. He and his family wanted to know for sure before they were going to emotionally attach to this child. I wanted to throw up.  It took about another 6 weeks before we all met up and took the test. A week of sleepless nights passed and we got back a negative on the test. That meant the TPR was not valid and the real Bdad might not be ok with the adoption. (A month later TPR was signed by her Bdad and we got a positive DNA test back!) My point is, I totally get where your DD's Bdad is coming from. My DD's FauxDad (as we call him now!) went to Dr. Visits with us, was at the hospital with us, ran and got Bmom Tums in the middle of the night and it ends up he ISN'T the Bdad.  I would want to know that a child that I am attaching to and is attaching to me won't someday have another guy show up and he's the actual Bdad. That would be crushing for everyone.  \n",

      "I think it is time to be just you, your husband and your son. OA should never be allowed to be used as a weapon or a form of torture. I think you know exactly what needs to be done. Do not let someone jerk you around.  I had to write a letter to my DD's bmom right before she got out of prison. (DD was placed at birth and bmom went in two months after DD was born and was in for 2.5 month).  I was brutally honest about how I felt. That my time, energy and money was taken advantage of. That I wanted to be friends and I would only do the things with her that I do with my friends (talk occasionally, text her cute pics of the baby, occasional lunch (she lives 30 minutes away). I listed what I did not do with friends (rescue them from drama, lend or give them money, run them around when they need a ride to get their hair done, etc. I told her I wished the very best for her and all that I wanted for her. I also made it clear for her to be that amazing woman people can not keep saving her, so I would no longer play that role. It has been heaven the past month! I am still anxious when she calls, assuming she will be asking for something. But she hasn't. She's been responsible and it's been great. So, back to how this started, I think it's time for you to \"take a break\" and have you time and energy forcused on not only being a mom, but a wife, friend, daughter, and sister.

Our DD's Bmom was a former employee of mine and knew we were looking into adoption when she left my company.

      "Do you mean her shins bow out? My husband was in grad school when our oldest was a toddler. We happened to be in an apartment complex full of students from a near by podiatry school. The husbands of my friends were freaking me out that something was wrong because she was about 18 months old a quite bow legged.  I took her to see her pediatrician and she told me that she would probably grow out of it and her opinion is to take no action in these cases because they usually naturally grow out of them and she refuses to put them in corrective braces, etc. If in a few years it was still the same, then they would take action.  She grew out of it with in a year or so. It's just how her legs were. It wasn't because of baby fat either, she was a skinny bird! So go see her dr. and don't stress. Its probably totally normal. And IF the doctor thinks there is something wrong and wants to take corrective action, get a second and third opinion before you do anything. =) JMTC  \n",
      "I would love any information you amazing ladies can give me. I know everything varies state to state, but I would love to know what you know. We are in the \"waiting to finalize\" stage with our two DS (10 months) and DD (5 months) that were placed through private adoptions. We also have two biological daughters, 9 and 7. We are from AZ and our homestudy is to adopt, but not done through the foster care system. My MIL is working in a pre-k class as an aide and the teacher (her other daughter-in-laws' sister) told my MIL that one of the students is in foster care and the courts are doing TPR for both bio-parents. The foster parents are older and want to keep fostering, not start adopting. My MIL told us about him, knowing we would like to adopt more children, and have talked about children that would be between DD#2 and DS's age. She told the teacher about us. The teacher is scheduled to meet with the foster parents Oct 1 and said she will tell them that we are interested in talking to the socialworker, etc.  So...is it possible to even have a chance if we are not currently foster parents? Will they consider families like mine, that don't foster? Do I have to be licensed to foster before he could be \"matched\" with us? Do they already have families in their systems they would match him with?  So, I'd love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, etc. I've never been in this \"world\" before. =)  \n",
      "Our first visit for our homestudy was at our house (we've had several since.) I was a nervous wreck! We have two daughters that are 9 and 7 and you NEVER know what could come out of their mouths! =) Our garage was messy and we had a project going on in the yard. I just could not get to them.  It was an extremely comfortable visit. She did not open the cabinets, fridge, closets, etc. She just peeked inside our master bedroom door and did not go in. She did not ask about the yard project or open the garage.  If this is for an adoption homestudy (not a foster care related), they are not there to see if your house is safety proofed, etc. They are there to verify the location of your home and the size. That's it! =) Your socialworker will understand if you have a dog and it acts like dogs act. They understand it will roam free (if it does) now because you don't have an infant in the room. =) Good luck. Really, don't stress. They are on your side. They are there to confirm info, not find reasons not to have you certified.  \n",
      "Last time there was this discussion I asked DS's Bmom this question. (DS was about 6 months old.) I already knew she thinks it is odd that girls she was in Bmom housing with refer to the infants they place as their son or daughter. SHE sees it as they have not dealt with the reality of the placement, etc.  I asked her how does she refer to DS when we aren't there and if we were? She has two older kids (10 and 7) and just kept saying they were her son and daughter and my DS was not. (In a VERY loving and matter of fact way.) But not \"her son\". I kept pressing the question (we have an awesome relationship) and she said, \"The baby I placed for adoption.\"  I asked, but what about when he is ten and by your side with us? Wouldn't that sound weird.  She thought and thought and said, \"I'd say, 'This is XXX, my angel.' If they were someone in my life that truly know me, they would know exactly who he was.\"  I almost started to cry. I told her, \"That's perfect.\" (About 4 weeks before DS was born, my daughters that are 7 and 9, asked us what her relationship was to us in front of her. I said, \"She's our Angel.\" She ans I looked at each other and started to cry.) She is one amazing lady. Just my thoughts.  \n",

Those symptoms improved but within a few days he had watery loose stools. He was unhappy, had to be changed ALL THE TIME, woke up all night, every night and his little bottom was raw. Dr. said it was not formula but probably reaction to antibiotics he'd been on. After a few more days I trusted my gut and put him all the way back to Good Start.

      "-Especially if she decides to not see the baby, make sure you trade off and spend time with her in the room. It is easy to feel like you want to let her rest and have some alone time, but she may feel that now that the baby has arrived, she is no longer important.  -Have a plan to go get her \"real\" food once the baby is settled.  -Every woman loves flowers. Having a nice basket of things you mentioned would be very sweet. A phone card is perfect to make sure she can make calls to family, etc without stressing about minutes. Bring her snacks, magazines, lotions, etc. If you didn't do pre-shopping maybe a fun pair of pajama's or comfortable clothes to change into after she showers. Even if she doesn't use them all there, she will love all the treats when she goes home.  -Before the big day, make sure she is prepared with all the post delivery needs - pads (big and small), sports bra or ace bandages for when her milk comes in, pain relievers, \"pad appropriate\" underware, etc. -Our DS was born in CA and his BMom was from Las Vegas. On the day she flew home I gave her a bracelet that has \"Our Angel\" engraved in it. It was personal yet vague for those who did not know about the adoption at home. We just visited her this past weekend, DS just turned 6 months, and she was wearing the bracelet. She loved whenever he would grab for it. =) -Something else that made a big difference for my husband, myself and DS's BMom is my sister was there during labor and delivery. She was able to take all the pictures right after the birth without DH or I having to decide to take pics or enjoy every moment. She was also by BMom side when she delivered after birth etc. BMom felt loved and taken care of and we could enjoy all the first moments. It also gave us an extra person to trade between food, nursery and being with BMom. Auntie didn't mind being included either! (We all came from out of state so it took some planning =)!)  -If she does change her mind and wants to hold the baby, even keep baby in the room with you guys, don't stress. Our DS BMom never decided what the plan would be and decided to hold him, take lots of pics, have alone time and we slept in the room together. I was thrilled that I could share all of that with our DS. It did not scare me that she was changing her mind. She was just loving him, like she had for the past 9 month.  -Be sure to take pictures with her camera too or use a disposable one that she can take home with her. Add a gift card for photo developing in the gift basket if you know what places she has around home. Hope this helps! I'm excited for you for your big day! Jolleen  \n",

      "The winds of change are blowing! Some of you may remember my story, but here is a synopsis for those who dont. In February 2001, as empty nesters, we became foster parents to get a HS senior 3 months before his graduation. At the end of summer he left for college while still in foster care. He has called us ғMom and ԓDad ever since. A month after his 18th birthday, the term adoption popped up in conversation, and he said, ԓThats it, Mom! Adopt me!Ҕ At the time I did not know it was even possible to legally adopt an adult or anyone whose parents were living, although his birthparents are out of the picture. The problem has been disagreement in the family. This foster son and I bonded almost immediately. My husband was spending a lot of time with another young man living with us (not in foster care), and perhaps because we divided our parenting between these two, he did not bond as quickly with FS as I who spent a lot of time with FS. In fact my husband admits he was jealous of our close relationship, and our oldest son still is, even though he was 30 y/o, married and with a son of his own when FS arrived on the scene. In fact Son #1 refused to come last Christmas and Easter (we live in the same town) because FS, now 20, was home. Son #2, now 31, married and with a 9 y/o stepdaughter, is a racist, Im ashamed to say (FS is of a different ethnicity), and says he doesnҒt trust FS although he hardly knows him. Son #3 and his wife have always been warm and welcoming, bless their hearts. Son #4, 23, is easy going, doesnt understand how I bonded like I did but will accept it, but he can be somewhat upset in allegiance with his oldest brother. I have been in favor of adoption ever since I knew it was possible. My husband is now over his jealousy but admits he does not feel the strong emotional bond that I do with FS or that he feels with our four bio sons. Not wanting to upset anyone, he has always hoped for consensus, but it has become evident that will not happen anytime soon. Geography prevents us all getting together easily, not everyone chooses to dialog through email or phone, and we donҒt want to cause our children to choose sides against one another in disagreement. My husband has recently decided therefore that it is time he and I take a stand and adopt this young man legally. We believe that adoption, what FS has longed for these last 3 years, is what Jesus would do, so we should do it and help the others work through their own feelings. This Thursday my husband and our three oldest sons will be together and he will tell them of our decision. Son #3 has already voiced his approval. Son #4 will hear by phone that night. The older two may be very upset, and there will be some issues to work through. Son #1, although a strong Christian man, is very irrational about the whole thing, but to wait until everyone is in agreement is simply too stressful. We will tell them again that we cannot make them feel as though FS is their brother as they did not grow up with him and some seldom see him. We do however expect that they will be kind and respectful. Please pray for strength for my husband on Thursday when he tells our oldest two sons and that they will be supportive even though they may not see the situation as we do. Thanks for your prayers and for reading this long post.  \n",
      "The saga continues. My husband and oldest bio son drove a couple of hours to a baseball game last week, and on the way my husband told our son of the intention to adopt our former foster son. Bio son #1 was not happy. At the baseball game they were met by Bio sons #2 and #3. Son #2 became very upset about our decision to adopt, even to the point of threatening violence to FS, whom he doesnt even know and who has done nothing to deserve his wrath. Son #3 wasnҒt saying much which made #2 angry at him also, so Son #3 left the game. THEN sons #1 and #2, at ages 33 and 31, began crying at the baseball game because they are so opposed to us adopting FS. I can hardly imagine the scene. My poor husband! As a result he has called a halt to adoption until the family can resolve some of these negative feelings. Meanwhile FS blames himself for bringing all this drama into our family. The situation is horrendous. The entire family, including bio Son #4 will be in town next weekend for a church celebration. We will be meeting with a couple who have agreed to mediate while we discuss the situation, if all will agree to be here. FS now feels unwelcome in his our home, and perhaps unsafe if Son #2 is here. It is the only real home he has ever known. I am aghast at the situation and cannot believe how my bio children, all of whom are adults, are behaving. I know some of them are jealous of FS with whom I have a close relationship. I believe that I matured wellӔ and was a better mom to FS than I was to our bio sons. Instead of being proud of me for getting betterӔ and helping someone less fortunate than themselves, they are jealous to the point of being vindictive. They do not say why they are so upset other than they are trying to preserve their original family. They ignore the fact that my husband and I love FS and will be his parents forever, even if it is not a legal relationship. Adoption of FS is on hold. Who would want to be adopted into this family? I am so sad.  \n",
      "Thanks for your response. I do not think inheritance is an issue. FS says he does not want any, that we have done so much for him already and he is very grateful. We did think that might be an issue so we are telling the family that he will not be receiving any of our estate. What would warm my heart is for the four of them to someday tell us that he SHOULD receive an inheritance. Receiving it from them would mean even more than receiving it from us. I do really believe that adoption, legal or not, should include a full inheritance. That is certainly biblical, but this is not a perfect world by any means. I'm also not sure that the jealousy I mentioned is the reason for their behavior. I really do not know and am stabbing in the dark, it seems. Our four have always been very close despite differences, but I didn't realize that they would behave as a clique. :(  \n",
      "I agree that it would be ideal to see a counselor, but not all the family will agree to do so and distance is usually a problem. My husband and I are close but not quite on the same page. We describe ourselves as intransigent about adoption (me) and wishy-washy (him, who wants to please everyone). If there were no objections, we both would adopt in a heartbeat. All the boys will be home this week end for a special occasion. We have asked a friend of the family who is also an attorney to mediate a discussion. All have agreed to be here for that. To start the discussion I have thought of the following. Please make any suggestions for how we might proceed. Thanks in advance for any help. \"What concerns everyone are feelings and behaviors. We cannot change other peoples feelings. It may be possible to change our own. We cannot change other peopleҒs behavior, but we can change our own. Write down your responses to these questions:  If you feel you have been hurt by Mom, what behavior(s) or event(s) make you feel that way? What behaviors you would like to see from Mom? If you feel you have been hurt by Dad, what behavior(s) or event(s) make you feel that way? What behaviors you would like to see from Dad?\"  \n",
      "withopenarms, mj77, and tybeemarie, Thanks for your responses and for checking back on me. I really like the comparison to the prodigal son parable and the reminder about being peacemakers. I wish I knew how to make peace in this situation. It was a very difficult evening last Friday. I think the only thing we really accomplished is to realize how strongly we each feel, that we really don't agree, and that just talking with us all together isn't going to help either. It was very evident that the boys are all dealing with this on an emotional rather than a rational level. #1 son is angry and says I should stop saying I have 5 sons. My definition of family is very broad while his is very narrow. #2 son continues to threaten violence to FS if he ever sees him again. #3 now admits he really doesnt see himself ever calling FS a brother although he would be kind. #4 is angry and says he canҒt understand how FS and I could have become attached and that it is messed upӔ. Although there are some differences amongst them, they strongly support each other. None of them are willing to do any counseling with me or anyone else. My husband just says give it time, but I think that will only allow everyone to ignore the issue until another holiday or crisis comes along. Of course FS now feels even more rejected. I have told him that I will never reject him, even if the rest of my sons never come around. I base that on Matthew 12:50, For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, and my sister, and mother.Ӕ I cannot see that any of my sons are treating FS in a Christian manner. Some of you have suggested talking to our pastor. My husband is a greatly loved pastor, and many in our congregation are aware of our family struggle.  \n",
      "tybeemarie, Thank you for such a beautiful response. I love that prayer. It really means a lot to me. Here is something I posted on the older child forum. I think I'll post it on the General Adoptive Parent forum as well and continue to respond primarily in that location as that is where I get the most responses. I would love to have a closer relationship with my bio sons. It is complex. For example, when #2 was 16 we did a drug intervention on him and ended up sending him to another state for treatment based on the experts advice. We didnҒt know what else to do, and he has never forgiven us for that. Nor has he quit using, so my husband and I will not base our decisions on his behavior except to safeguard FS. Last Christmas when #4 was home he and I had fun shopping together. I bought him clothes and stuff for his apartment until he said, Stop, Mom, you have spent enough money on me already!Ӕ This summer I phoned him and left messages which he didnt return and sent emails he never answered. I even wrote a poem for him and he never even acknowledged it. None of that bothers me. I consider it perfectly normal for a college student, until he tells me that he wishes we had a closer relationship. I don't think any of them understand attachment and how it could occur between parents and children who are not biologically related. I can only think the others, like #2 must have something in the past that they wonҒt face or discuss, but I dont have a clue what it might be. I have apologized to them for my failings as their mother in ways known and unknown, but maybe they think that for them to admit that I was a less-than-perfect mom would mean that they are less-than-perfect kids. For example, I wrote to them all this summer and apologized for spanking them, told them that our parents and parental role models all spanked, and that I now would never hit a child. My oldest son and father of a 3 y/o wrote back and said simply, ғGet real, Mom. They are jealous of FS and admit it. They were never jealous when the newest bio brother was born. We made sure the older ones got plenty of love and attention and were included in the care of the baby. The difference this time is that they were all gone when FS came along and three were married or engaged, well beyond the age when I would have expected and prepared for jealousy as a factor. I truly and naively expected them to welcome FS with open arms as they really are very compassionate guys except in this instance.  \n",
      "This could be the biggest test of his young life. It has nothing to do with respect; he has no reason to disrespect you, and you have said he is a wonderful young man. You have really nothing to lose and possibly a son to gain by being absolutely truthful with him about your feelings. What are the possible outcomes for him? He could realize how very much you love him and are committed to him and then change his mind. Or he could still refuse to be won over and age out in a group home. If he chooses the latter, he may or may not someday regret his decision and/or block it all out of his mind. What are the possible outcomes for you? He could change his mind and decide to become your son. If he refuses, all you have done is told the truth and shared your feelings with a hurting 15 year-old kid. That is a very small risk for you to take. I suggest you share you feelings with him in a letter and send a copy to his social worker. That kind of public statement of your commitment to him and the encouragement of another adult who knows him could be very beneficial. Suggest that he at least visit your home without any pressure of having to make up his mind. This is the scariest and most important decision of his life and he knows it.  \n",
      "So very sorry for you. This must be heartbreaking to have come so close.  \n",
      "Tomorrow I will be talking with my oldest bio son (33) about our mother-son relationship, the possible adoption of our former foster son (20), and the jealousy he feels toward that young man. Please pray that our discussion will be fruitful and that we will share our feelings honestly and be able to really \"hear\" one another. It has been three years of conflict alternating with ignoring the situation, and it is taking its toll on the entire extended family. Thanks.  \n",
      "We had a very good day, so thank you for praying. My oldest bio son (#1) is a flooring contractor. I spent 8 hours with him while he installed carpet in 6 rooms. I wasn't able to help much, but we were able to talk the whole time. #1 son has said I am delusional for thinking I have 5 sons (4 bio). He had been married 9 years and had an infant son of his own when FS came on the scene, so I was totally surprised when I first learned of his feelings 3 years ago. He would like me to say I am \"like a mom\" or a \"parent figure\" to FS. I refuse as FS and I have bonded and have called each other mother and son for over two years now. I will not abandon FS even semantically. On the other hand #1 son would like me to spend more time with him and his family which I will be happy to do as they live nearby. #1 son says it is not about FS at all, whom he acknowledges is a fine person, but about who is in the \"family\". I cannot believe that he is being so unwelcoming. Since last November he refuses to be around FS and me when we are together as long as I say FS is a son. That meant he refused to come here at Christmas, and he will not go on any family vacation with his brothers and their wives and kids if FS comes as well. However he and all his wife's extended family came for Mother's Day. I love them all, but wanted to tell the hypocrits to go home as they only came to my house because FS was not here. I didn't though as I do realize they are caught in the middle. (I did post a poem about it in the poetry section.) DH and I agree that we will never be so cruel as to tell FS he cannot come home for Christmas or any other time, so in a sense we are at a stalemate unless #1 son feels better about me spending more time with him and his family. Nevertheless it really was a good day. Neither of us got upset or angry, however I don't know what will happen next or how long it will be before there is some resolution. By the way I only use \"FS\" for clarity in this post and never refer to him as anything other than my son. Thank you again, Judy, for praying.  \n",
      "I echo what mj77 says. Give your friends and family advance notice. You will not want them making off-the-wall comments around your new child, and time will give all of you a chance to honestly talk things over. If they get out of line, you can tell them you will not tolerate comments like that, but hopefully they will express support and you can thank them.  \n",
      "To me, this passage is what adoption is all about, especially regarding the older child and his/her incorporation into the existing family. Matthew 20:1-16 1For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard. 2He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard. 3 ӓAbout the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. 4He told them, You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.ђ 5So they went. He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing. About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, ӑWhy have you been standing here all day long doing nothing? 7ғBecause no one has hired us,ђ they answered. He said to them, ӑYou also go and work in my vineyard. 8ғWhen evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.ђ 9The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius. 10So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. 11When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. 12ӑThese men who were hired last worked only one hour, they said, ґand you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day. 13ғBut he answered one of them, Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Didnђt you agree to work for a denarius? 14Take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you. 15Dont I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?Ғ 16So the last will be first, and the first will be last.Ӕ New International Version  \n",
      "Maybe it's just that it fits my family's situation so well. :) I've posted on another thread that we are discussing with our grown children, not all of whom are in agreement right now, the adoption of a college student whom we met through foster care as a high school senior. Those who love the Lord are adopted into His family at many different ages and stages of our lives, and there is always room in His family for more. Some may believe that, since they joined the family long ago, their reward should be greater than that of a newcomer or elderly adoptee, yet we all share equally the same inheritance of eternal life.  \n",

She needs to call the police if he is violent and tell him in advance that she will do so. The state is no longer his parent unless she relinquishes. They will not automatically take him back. If your mother cannot or will not parent him and you are willing to try, then you must be the one to lay out the rules and follow through. Consistency is most important.

      "Well, it was a nice break when I could go to the bathroom whenever I wanted, eat anytime I wanted, walk 2 2/3 mile each 12 of the 16 days and 10 of those outdoors until the snow came, take a class by CD-rom, see some of my bio kids and some youth who formerly lived with us, my 3 y/o grandson, read The Kiterunner(excellent!), write a poem, cry myself to sleep a couple of nights about what is happening in my family and still sleep more than my usual 4-5 hours a night. ;) BUT now it's back to eight hours a day with over 100 teenagers, many of whom will stay after school for help or just to talk, those sometimes irrelevant meetings when there are papers to grade, and a new policy this year that says we have to teach Algebra 1 to students some of whom can't multiple 3X7, others who don't speak English, and some who cannot read in ANY language. :confused: AND these students have all been combined in heterogeneous classrooms and are supposed to \"discover together\" how to do Algebra! :( Nevertheless, I love my job, most of the time! May God bless us all, whatever we do. :)  \n",
      "spaypets, I think the key is in your quote, \"ISIL adores my dd, but I think she's just ignorant about adoption etiquette.\" While I take opportunities to gently correct individuals who are ignorant, I have always found it best for all concerned to assume that there was no harm intended. Maybe it would help to brush off and view her comments as amusingly odd or as though from a person with limited intellect! My Ason is of a different ethnicity. He came to us at 17 and is very astute. I asked him once when he was 19 how he felt about being called my son in public because, although I am proud to be his mom, I didn't want to draw unwanted attention for him. He said, \"Mom, I am over the fact that I do not look like you. I like people to know that there are options for families.\"  \n",
      "spaypets, Glad your dh is going to speak to her. I think all will be ok. We can all still grow up some more no matter how old we are. It's never too late to learn something. Regarding what others say, sometimes it's just nice that people notice and are brave enough to say something. I had a still born son at 7 months. No mistaking to anyone that I had been pregnant, but when I had obviously delivered and there was no baby, most people said nothing. They just didn't know how to handle it.  \n",
      "Definitely ask him how he feels and go with it. At his age, it should be his decision. Let him know how you feel also, that as a parent you desire to protect him but realize he has more experience with his bmom than you and that you understand how deep but at times possibly painful their connection is. Let him you support their relationship but are also there to listen after they talk. Give him permission to use you as the \"bad guy\" if he prefers, by telling her later when she is sober that you would not allow him to speak with her when she is drunk even if it was his desire. I hope I am explaining that ok!  \n",

      "I havent posted about my story for a long time. Here is the link to earlier posting: [url]http://forums.adoption.com/showthread.php?t=166056[/url]. Some of you may remember I have four bio sons, ages 33 to 24, three married, four grandkids, and a former foster son, who came at 17, is now 21, and wants to be adopted. We have had many young people live with us for all the years weҒve been married, either foster kids, summer interns for our church, or other high school students, none of whom needed or wanted adoption. DH and I would adopt FS in a minute, but bios are jealous. The older three even refused to come home last Christmas because FS was home from college. Third son just didnt want to be around conflict. The oldest two refuse to be anywhere where FS and I are together. In September, all four were home for a huge celebration for DH (20 years as pastor of a large church). FS knew he was not welcome by them and didnҒt come home. To be rejected and left out of that event was devastating to him. He lost 15 pounds in two weeks, plummeted into depression worse than anything he had experienced due to the brutal abuse and neglect he had experienced with his Bfam, and started meds. Knowing all bios but the youngest would not come home if he were here, FS chose to visit a friend for Thanksgiving and his 21st BD (just days later) and now is in Mexico for his entire 3 week Xmas break where he may see some of his relatives. We purchased his ticket for him. His girlfriend is with him the entire time, and another friend will join them for a week. Thankfully he will not be alone as that could be dangerous. I am very angry with my bio sons over this. I feel that they have robbed DH, FS, and me of family holidays we will never get back. FS is a college senior and most college students go home for holidays. I cannot expect that he will spend any future holidays with us as he may end up in a job thousands of miles away after graduation. Three of the four bio sons will be home for Christmas. Work and new baby prevent the other one. Recently the oldest said he might consider being present when FS and I are together IF the rest of his brothers would agree. EXCUSE ME? We are not voting on this! How devastating to FS would that be? I refuse to back down and reject FS by saying he is not really a son. FS says no one in his life has ever stood up for him like I have. I am also angry with DH believing that if we had gone ahead with adoption when it first came up, we would not be in this mess, but DH negotiates for compromise, a positive characteristic in his job but not in this family situation! I know our sons would not have rejected BOTH of their parents over this. DH and I are seeing a counselor to help us deal with the situation. How should I handle being around my bios sons over Christmas? # 4 arrives Monday, #2 on Thursday, and #1 lives in town. We will have 9 for Christmas breakfast and morning present opening and then nearly 20 for dinner. In some ways I donݒt want to be here at all. I sometimes cry at the drop of a hat just thinking about the whole situation and how cruel it must seem to FS. I guess that would signal a retreat to my bedroom. Sorry this is so long. Any thoughts or suggestions?  \n",
      "I am trying hard to put all this into perspective. My older kids are not only jealous, they see my relationship to FS as over-the-top involvement. In my mind, God had given me a child in need of intensive care. This recent quote from Dr. Art validates all the things I was doing instinctively with FS, and he and I attached quickly and deeply. FS has thanked me repeatedly for loving, trusting, and caring for him. The key point to remember is that structure and rules DO NOT heal a child. It is maintaining a healing PLACE (being playful, loving, accepting, curious (about he underlying feelings driving the behavior), and empathic) Structure is put in place to keep the child safe, but does not, in and of itself, heal.Ӕ Dr. Art I never expected my older sons would be jealous at their ages and stages of life. Both DH and I think they ought to be proud of us. Sigh. Now I guess they are in need of intensive care also, and I need to get beyond my anger to care for them. For this I need Gods help.  \n",
      "Number 4 son (24) arrived last night. He is really a great kid, as they all are, and I really cannot be angry at any of them when I am with them. Number 3 (27 and father of 2) just phoned to get FS's address so they could mail him a gift. They are very accepting of FS and have always given him gifts and been hospitable. They just don't like conflict and that son is not sure about calling him a brother. His wife's parents divorced. She understands rejection and so has always been empathetic to FS. We are not asking that any call him \"Brother\", only that they be kind. Savannah2, I do understand where you are coming from. My oldest son was involved in a battle in the Gulf War, and when he left I was afraid I'd never see him again. Now I am unable to see or read about any war in the news as a result. It is too painful to think about even now. I also had a friend lose a daughter in an accident last year. Thanks again for all your responses. JJ and JewelMarie, you are right. Even though they are all adults, they are all my kids and I love them all so much. Maybe when they get their second kids they will understand more about the love of parents. Michelle, I will definitely use your letter form and can tell it will be helpful. Thanks so much for sending it.

I don't know of any other as I was happy and satisfied to find this one!

      "With our kids, we have paid all school expenses such as books and tuition, room and board. It has been their responsibility to buy their own clothes and pay for any entertainment and extra food costs with money they have earned themselves. That being said, I now wish we had made a deal with them that we would reimburse them by half for any funds which they earned through scholarships and retained through good grades. For example, if they earned a $2000 scholarship toward college, we could put $1000 in the bank available to them at graduation. That way we would both be ahead financially and the student would be motivated to study harder to qualify and motivated to do the research and fill out the applications. There are many scholarships out there that don't even get used. The idea came to me too late to use it, however!  \n",
      "I too am sorry for your loss. My father died when I was in high school. Mom remarried just before my 3rd son was born and both she and her husband, my stepdad, died about 10 years ago.

      "I have been in and out of town for a couple of days and have barely peeked at the forum. I am addicted to this site where I find the only people I know except my ason who understand what is going on in our lives, but I am hopelessly behind on reading the forums to which I subscribe and find myself unable to finish reading many posts or respond right now. I guess I am emotionally wrung out as I find myself crying at just about anything I read. We brought our son home for the weekend for some R & R and just time with us. It was so good to be with him but sad at the same time. Because of our family situation, he does not want to come home for either Thanksgiving or Christmas. We understand, but it is very difficult and sad. He has lost 15 pounds in three weeks, is depressed, admits he is suicidal, and is taking antidepressant medication. His 21st BD is Thanksgiving weekend and he will spend the holiday and BD with a friend in another state. He knows our other sons do not want him around for Christmas, and although we would love to have him even if they refuse to come around, that would make him feel very uncomfortable believing himself to be the cause. He is choosing instead to travel for a month to the very large city where his birthfamily lives. He has some friends and other connections there and will take a friend along. Nevertheless, I am concerned for his safety, both physical and emotional. My husband purchased his ticket today as a gift. We might see him for a weekend in early November and then not again until late January, if then. It is so sad to see him in such pain right now. I am having a very hard time.  \n",
      "Thanks for the prayers. I know God is listening. I do feel a bit better today, and our son reported a good day at school, having done well with a presentation. He is taking off from college for a conference across the country and will have some responsibilities, so he is excited about that, but it does add to his stress also, as well as missing classes for three days. Thanks for the tip on the antidepressant meds, Linda. This is not the first time he has been on them, but it is the first time since we have known him. He started with Prozac and then was switched to Zoloft (?). The dosage was increased also. I know nothing about any of them, but I will pass on your advice and encourage him to get some answers. He is living in his college town, so I do not know the doctor. He is a psychiatrist recommended by the college health center. Maybe tomorrow I will have the energy to post a more complete update on our situation. The water heater sprung a leak tonight and I had to deal with a bit of a flood. Then I had to go to a friend's house to shower! Luckily most of the laundry is done and the dishwasher ran this morning.  \n",
      "I am back to the weight I was when we married many years ago. I have been at that weight for four years now, and it feels so good. I struggled for many years wishing to be 15-20 pounds lighter, so I know how you are all feeling. I, too, love gravy, but I pour off ALL the fat before making it. Shake the flour and water or milk together and pour into the pan to cook the gravy. Make cookies with half of the butter in the recipe. You can reduce the fat in many cake recipes also. Try using only whole wheat flour for cookies, no white at all. Do this also for pancakes and waffles. They require no other adjustment. I also make most cakes with all whole wheat flour and no one eats any less of it! It is almost unnoticable in carrot, banana, pumpkin, or chocolate. Some don't rise quite as high, but who really cares about that. Also use half of the chocolate chips in cookies and use the mini ones so they distribute better. Never eat seconds of anything but fruit and veggies. I drink only non-fat milk saving the butterfat for ice cream where it really counts! Make yourself only 1/2 sandwiches, skip the mayonnaise and butter, and use lots of lettuce, tomatoes, or mustard for moisture instead. Drink a glass of milk 1/2 hour before a meal. It reduces your appetite as well as providing your calcium. Drink lots of water. I walk over 2 1/2 miles every day when school is out (I'm a teacher) with headphone radio outdoors or treadmill with tv. I walk Saturdays, Sundays, and occasional other days during the school year. Deliberate physical exercise really does reduce your appetite. There really is a very noticable reduction after just a couple of days. Above all, enjoy your kids and tell yourself you are working on it for them as well as yourself. Good luck to all.  \n",

      "The winds of change are blowing! Some of you may remember my story, but here is a synopsis for those who dont. In February 2001, as empty nesters, we became foster parents to get a HS senior 3 months before his graduation. At the end of summer he left for college while still in foster care. He has called us ғMom and ԓDad ever since. A month after his 18th birthday, the term adoption popped up in conversation, and he said, ԓThats it, Mom! Adopt me!Ҕ At the time I did not know it was even possible to legally adopt an adult or anyone whose parents were living, although his birthparents are out of the picture. The problem has been disagreement in the family. This foster son and I bonded almost immediately. My husband was spending a lot of time with another young man living with us (not in foster care), and perhaps because we divided our parenting between these two, he did not bond as quickly with FS as I who spent a lot of time with FS. In fact my husband admits he was jealous of our close relationship, and our oldest son still is, even though he was 30 y/o, married and with a son of his own when FS arrived on the scene. In fact Son #1 refused to come last Christmas and Easter (we live in the same town) because FS, now 20, was home. Son #2, now 31, married and with a 9 y/o stepdaughter, is a racist, Im ashamed to say (FS is of a different ethnicity), and says he doesnҒt trust FS although he hardly knows him. Son #3 and his wife have always been warm and welcoming, bless their hearts. Son #4, 23, is easy going, doesnt understand how I bonded like I did but will accept it, but he can be somewhat upset in allegiance with his oldest brother. I have been in favor of adoption ever since I knew it was possible. My husband is now over his jealousy but admits he does not feel the strong emotional bond that I do with FS or that he feels with our four bio sons. Not wanting to upset anyone, he has always hoped for consensus, but it has become evident that will not happen anytime soon. Geography prevents us all getting together easily, not everyone chooses to dialog through email or phone, and we donҒt want to cause our children to choose sides against one another in disagreement. My husband has recently decided therefore that it is time he and I take a stand and adopt this young man legally. We believe that adoption, what FS has longed for these last 3 years, is what Jesus would do, so we should do it and help the others work through their own feelings. This Thursday my husband and our three oldest sons will be together and he will tell them of our decision. Son #3 has already voiced his approval. Son #4 will hear by phone that night. The older two may be very upset, and there will be some issues to work through. Son #1, although a strong Christian man, is very irrational about the whole thing, but to wait until everyone is in agreement is simply too stressful. We will tell them again that we cannot make them feel as though FS is their brother as they did not grow up with him and some seldom see him. We do however expect that they will be kind and respectful. Please pray for strength for my husband on Thursday when he tells our oldest two sons and that they will be supportive even though they may not see the situation as we do. Thanks for your prayers and for reading this long post.  \n",
      "I would love to have a closer relationship with my bio sons. It is complex. For example, when #2 was 16 we did a drug intervention on him and ended up sending him to another state for treatment based on the experts advice. We didnҒt know what else to do, and he has never forgiven us for that. Nor has he quit using, so my husband and I will not base our decisions on his behavior except to safeguard FS. Last Christmas when #4 was home he and I had fun shopping together. I bought him clothes and stuff for his apartment until he said, Stop, Mom, you have spent enough money on me already!Ӕ This summer I phoned him and left messages which he didnt return and sent emails he never answered. I even wrote a poem for him and he never even acknowledged it. None of that bothers me. I consider it perfectly normal for a college student, until he tells me that he wishes we had a closer relationship. I don't think any of them understand attachment and how it could occur between parents and children who are not biologically related. I can only think the others, like #2 must have something in the past that they wonҒt face or discuss, but I dont have a clue what it might be. I have apologized to them for my failings as their mother in ways known and unknown, but maybe they think that for them to admit that I was a less-than-perfect mom would mean that they are less-than-perfect kids. For example, I wrote to them all this summer and apologized for spanking them, told them that our parents and parental role models all spanked, and that I now would never hit a child. My oldest son and father of a 3 y/o wrote back and said simply, ғGet real, Mom. Yes they are jealous and admit it. They were never jealous when the newest bio brother was born. We made sure the older ones got plenty of love and attention and were included in the care of the baby. The difference this time is that they were all gone when FS came along and three were married or engaged, well beyond the age when I would have expected and prepared for jealousy as a factor. I truly and naively expected them to welcome FS with open arms as they really are very compassionate guys except in this instance.  \n",
      "No, Sarah, the four bio sons are all ours, no stepsons. My husband and I have been married 36 years. Dadfor2, FS has never done or said anything mean to the other boys. He has even bought them and their wives and kids gifts for Christmases. He is very generous and tender-hearted. Nicole, it may be a problem for our other sons that FS is to all appearances very successful. He is an honor student in college, a sought-after speaker, and is planning to go to law school. Some of my sons may wonder why he needs parents when he SEEMS so put together. They know he has been neglected and abused but they dont know details and say they arenҒt interested. I suppose they might be more accepting if he appeared needier or, yes savannah2, if he were an eight year-old. Funny, though, they are not ready to give up their parents now that they are adults. They dont understand, and seem not to care, about the pervasive pain in his heart due to rejection. He suffers from PTSD, but hides it well. Spaypets, our sons know that we are not putting FS in our wills. I donҒt think it is right not to and would include him equally, but I know with things the way they are now it would only make the situation worse. What would mean the world to FS is for the boys to consider him a brother after we are gone. They are not unusually competitive with each other; they are very close. I doubt they think my feelings are anything other than maternal. If they did, my husband would set them straight. They think I am over-doing the mother thing with him, doting on him, I guess, but they dont know how much he has healed emotionally since being in our home. Both my husband and I see he still has a long ways to go and needs us very much. I love to spoil the others when they are home too. Legal adoption is off the table for now as it will only anger the others. You are right. It only puts a legal face on what is in our hearts. We have made it clear to the others that FS will continue to call us ғMom and ԓDad and we will call him ԓSon. We are adamant that we will not reject him. One thing that is upsetting to me is that our bio sons donԒt trust my husband and me. It is not like we are trying to bring some pervert into the family. What is sad is that their behavior and attitude make me want to be with them less and at the same time it strengthens my desire to care for FS all the more due to the added pain they are inflicting on him. My husband points out that what we have done for FS is really what any of our sons would have done. Like I said earlier, I truly expected they would all rally around him. The love and support should have come from all of us, not just my husband and me. Boy, was I ever surprised.  \n",
      "It is after 4 in the morning. The alarm will go off at 6:20. I have to teach school in a few hours. I brought home a briefcase full of papers I never got to look at. I wrote my lesson plans for today at 3 AM. This situation consumes my thoughts all day except when I am in front of the classroom. Worse, FS is unable to concentrate at college, has lost weight and his appetite, has had dizziness, fainting spells, had blood drawn at the hospital for tests, and is now questioning whether God really knew what He was doing when He introduced us. He and I talked from midnight to one in the morning, and then I wrote to him. I am just trying to encourage him and keep his spirits up.

      "I just posted the following earlier this month on another thread! I raised four boys and never used a child's potty after my oldest also used it as a hat, Anna! I found it best to lift a small child up onto the regular big toilet seat facing the tank. They can hold onto the seat in front of them, are leaning slightly forward, can watch the action, correct angle for the stream, and no one is flushing behind their backs. Works for girls also. When they get bigger, they can climb up by themselves. Facing that direction they feel secure and in control. Eventually boys learn to stand (and miss!) and girls to turn around. The biggest advantage is that they are not frightened by adult toilets at anyone else's home or in a store or restaurant. Training really only took a few days and we were at home much more that week or so. For rewards we offered juice so they'd have to go more often and get more practice (!) and a single mini-marshmallow or a candy corn. They wanted to do whatever we did so we just showed them how when they indicated an interest. Good luck!  \n",
      "I would remove only one shoe. If long pants had crotch snaps I would snap them diagonally over one shoulder to keep them out of the way. I guess warm weather helps in that they can just run around in training pants. No shoes in the house helps during this period too. I didn't want to deal with wet carpet or puddles. It also seemed too scarey for a small boy to face forward, hold his penis down with one hand and hang onto the toilet with the other while his knees are held together by his clothes. I was afraid he might fall in backwards! If it is any encouragement for some of you, our second son was barely two when he woke us up flushing the toilet in the middle of the night.

He was a student at the HS where I teach, but I didn't know him until we heard of his situation. Anyway, just to say \"been there, done that\" and it has been incredible. He will be a college senior this year, and we hope to adopt soon. He called us by our first names to start. As he never had a dad who treated him properly, he asked my husband if he could call him \"Dad\" pretty early. When he went to college he referred to us as his parents, so I asked if he wanted to call us \"Mom\" and \"Dad\" and he said he did. Ask him how he would like to refer to you with his classmates. That might lead to a good discussion and make the decision easier. If he starts with your first names, that might lead to more questions from his friends than he wants to answer, especially if he changes to \"Mom\" and \"Dad\" after a few months. When you finally get him into your home, it might still be somewhat awkward at first. We had a snack after his former foster parents left and then moved furniture! The bedroom he was actually going to occupy was a different one than we had told the SW, but we needed to move out a heavy desk and move beds downstairs, etc. It lightened the atmosphere and we had a lot of laughs in the process. For us, having a task like that made it easier, so maybe you could clean the garage or remove some tree roots or put up some jam! God bless you for taking a teenage boy. They need moms and dads as much as the little ones. Tears of joy for you!  \n",
      "Spring break 2002 we took our 16 y/o foster daughter and her younger sister, also in foster care but in a group home in a different state, to Canada for a week. All social workers approved, and of course we had to have papers signed by court, but since all the adults, as well as the kids, wanted to make it happen, everyone worked together so that it did. Surely in your case everyone wants to make this happen. There must be some way to get temporary custody, even if by the week or month, so that he could be with you sooner. What about you being respite foster parents? I'm sure the group home could use his bed. What about school? Can't the people in charge see the benefit for him to start school where he will finish the year? Whose \"best interest\" are the authorities looking out for, for crying out loud. :mad: I'm praying for your family. Midmodad and DinPAis2adopt, blessings to you also for opening your hearts and homes to older kids. They are awesome and so are you.  \n",
      "Last night I found and read an entire thread entitled \"Why do teenagers get pregnant?\" I believe all those who contributed are female. I'd love to hear from some guys on this issue, but the question has to be changed. Why do guys have pre-marital sex or unprotected sex? Do guys just not worry too much since you can't get pregnant or figure it's the girl's problem? Were you sexually abused and was that a factor? Did you feel like damaged goods? Is it too hard not to continue having sex once you have experienced it already? Do you believe having sex is OK if you really care about her and you're just having fun even though you are not planning to marry yet? Were you just acting upon the old \"it's all a guy really thinks about anyway\" syndrome? Do you have regrets now if you are older or married? Can you fellows share your opinions, knowledge, or advice on how to help guys wait and/or be responsible? Thanks in advance for any who are willing to share.  \n",
      "Since you get along well with your MIL why not tell her how much you appreciate her inclusiveness. After \"buttering her up\" a bit share that you wish her hubby was as congenial as she. Or maybe have your DH try to reach his dad through his mom. Just a thought.  \n",
      "I'm with Opus, naive, and with a poor memory to boot! I devote hours to the forum in the summer and very little time during the school year.

I am definitely not FBI material! :D I will soon be gone for two weeks, in case any one is keeping tabs on me.  \n",

      "If your niece stays with her current foster family, and it sounds like you know them well, will she continue to have contact with you and any other blood relatives? How well does she know you now? Based on little info, I'd say leave her be. If she is well cared for and loved in a Christian home, which you value, moving is needlessly traumatic, especially if you will be able to remain as aunt, uncle and cousins to her. God bless you and your new addition also.  \n",
      "My son came to us through foster care 3 months before HS graduation and will be a college senior next year. Summer school and employment has meant that he is only home for about four weeks total in the year. He and I are very close, and I miss him so much. It is different than with my four bio sons. Although I missed them in varying degrees, when they moved out it was the right time. This new one only lived with us for six months before leaving for college, and we were still getting to know one another. He is leading a perfectly normal life, studying, working, making friends, and like any normal kid, having less and less time for parents. We do email, but not seeing him or hearing from him as often as Id like is very hard for me. How have others of you handled the pain of this separation from adopted or bio kids with whom you were very close?  \n",
      "He came to us as a stranger in FC at the end of February, graduated in June, and was off to college at the end of August, so we had only known him six months before he left. He is usually home about 10 days at Christmas, another 10 at the end of summer and a few assorted long weekends (of laundry and packing, lol) at other times in the year. We have fostered and had other youth live with us since he left, but they were not permanent, and the bond was not the same. Thank you for responding. I really know keeping busy is the answer. I was just hoping for some kind of magic solution for the melancholy, I guess. He is so busy, an honor student and so very involved in activities that communication has dwindled. In addition he will be in a remote area of the world for six weeks soon. I don't doubt his love for us. We are very close, and both of us consider it a miracle; it is just so hard not to hear from him as often as I'd like.  \n",
      "I have a grandson who went through a stage of calling his dad by his first name. We were all amused by it. Eventually he went back to calling him \"Dad\", but it was cute and funny to see what children come up with on their own as they learn language, etc. In the end, the strong personal desire to be \"normal\" and have parents like everyone else will probably result in you being called \"Mom\" and \"Dad\" within a short time if you are not pushy about it. I would leave it completely up to the child and tell him/her so at the beginning and never mention it again. I know of a step-parent adoption where the stepdad has tried to get the 8 y/o stepdaughter to call him \"Dad\" to no avail. At that age, it really is up to the child as he/she grows to accept, love, and bond with new parents. Those feelings cannot be forced, and you will feel so honored when you hear \"Mom\" or \"Dad\" for the first time by choice. The child will also realize that the rest of the world can use your first name but only a child has the priviledge to use \"Mom\" and \"Dad.\" God bless.  \n",
      "I would assume she wants to call you \"Mom\" in a genuine way but feels a bit shy about it yet. Like you said, her FM was \"Mom\" for most of her life and she knows you have heard her call FM \"Mom\". She probably thinks she can't have 2 moms and is trying to make the transition in her own way. The baby talk is her way of saying \"This is a little strange!\" Don't make anything of the baby talk, and it will disappear in time, and the less you make of it the sooner. That's my guess. :)  \n",
      "I am extremely sentimental also, and I think I would try to time the dedication so that the grandparents could attend both occasions. A dedication is very special and symbolic and moving ceremony at which a 3 month child is a passive participant. At a first birthday party, the child is a very active center of attention. Neither grandchild will remember the events, so the presence of grandparents and other guests is to honor the child and for the pleasure of the parents and for the photos that document the celebrations. Are you also invited to the birthday party? If so, perhaps you can set the time for the dedication when you can also briefly attend the birthday party in addition to your husband's parents. I would make an appearance at the BD party with your daughter but not stay so long as to draw attention away from the BD girl. Please try not to read too much into the time spent with each girl at this point other than the in/convenience of location. I think the key thing to remember is that these little girls will be cousins for a lifetime, and you do not want any adult's bad feelings, especially those of any aunts and uncles, to poison the water of their future relationship. If you treat grandparents as though they think she is second fiddle, she will eventually pick up on that. Visualize these girls as 6, 12, and 16 year-old cousins who are very close and keep that goal in mind. This may require setting aside your own feelings and assuming only the best of intentions from everyone else in your daughter's life. Accentuate the positive!  \n",

      "What age child are you hoping to adopt? I have a few ideas. Use her suggestions for decorating the new child's room or area, no matter what how crazy the colors etc. may be. It will be a special memory for all of you later on. Will your daughter be able to help with the new one like feeding, bathing, dressing, and taking for walks in a stroller? If so, enlist her help any time she offers, if possible. If you find you can trust her to care for the new one, give them plenty of playtime together. My boys often included the newest arrival in many of their imaginary games, dressing them in costumes, reading favorite stories (even to infants), hiding the baby for a treasure hunt, playing together in the back of the pick-up, and so on. Children know when they are trusted and usually show their appreciation by being very responsible. Let her choose a new book for herself and one for the new child each month. Also, do something new with your daughter, like teaching her to cook some of her favorite foods from scratch, or have her choose the menu for one dinner each month where you help her shop and cook. Accept any reasonable menu! Teach her some new skill or craft. God bless, Julie  \n",
      "I agree with everyone about everything also. If you end up in conflict with this friend and birthmom, so be it. Your first obligation is to your child, not your friend. If you can't be strong enough to put her best interests first, you may have more troubles down the road. I agree that babies do not belong at weddings! They attract attention to themselves and away from the couple and ceremony with the slightest squeaks, annoying and distracting those around who would like to hear what is going on. Baby can come out of the nursery, if it is at a church, when the ceremony is over. I hope you can work this all out quickly. Julie  \n",

Not too young to love children, but too young to have the responsibility of all the adult decisions that must be made and sacrifices parents make to parent well. How about volunteering at a local after-school program or children's day care or church nursery where your love for little ones can have an outlet, yet you can still clock out and live the life of a young maturing adult getting to know herself. Take some classes in psychology at your local college if you are not currently a student. That will help prepare you to parent better when you are a bit older.  \n",

      "Some of you have asked, and now I'm finally posting my situation. Both my husband and my a-son have read this. I hope some of you have some insight. Sorry this is so long. Two and a half years ago we took a high school senior in foster care. He is three years younger than our youngest, and the state was going to move him again (already six high schools) due to transportation difficulties. He is extremely kind, sensitive, loving and generous with all that God has given him. He is now an honor student in college, a permanent member of our family, and we are discussing legal adoption within our family. Therein lies the problem. Its not that my husband and other four sons are not kind, loving and generous. They are very much so. ItҒs just that some dont want another child in the family, and some are jealous as the new one and I are very close. During the six months that this 5th son lived with us, my husband and my first son communicated to me that they felt I was spending too much time and energy with this new son. This has developed into some jealousy and made it harder for them to be open to legal adoption. In my mind, the new one was a new child who needed and benefited from intensive care. The sons were 30, 28, 23, and 20 and all out of the home two years ago when the new one showed up at age 17, so they will never get to know him in the sense of growing up together; most see him only at holidays. Sons #1 and 3 are married and each has a son. Son #2 has a girlfriend with an 8 year old daughter whose father deserted mom and her at two days. He is appalled that this girlҒs father would walk out on her. Son #4 and A-Son (#5) have spent time together during their last two spring breaks and get along very well. Son #3 has said Obviously it is GodӒs will that #5 has a family (birth family is out of the picture). The question is whether we are to be that family. Although I believe he is correct, that is no longer the question. We are his family. #5 is looking for no other. We are the end of the line, however it ends. It is just that I know how important the legal step really is to him. I understand what it speaks to his heart that he is ours forever, no matter what, no refunds. My husband says he would adopt if the rest of the family agreed. Some donԒt understand why a 19 year-old needs parents, yet they dont want to give us up as their parents. IҒm not sure if everyone will ever agree. I recently came to realize that my situation is similar to that of a birthmother trying to integrate a previous child into her younger family. Its just that I am trying to integrate a younger adoptee into a previous family. Any suggestions? This is truly agonizing to me.  \n",
      "Thanks for your responses. I know hubby and I must agree on this. He has said he will talk to the others. To me it is a no-brainer, and I am anxious to just do it, but hubby wants consensus or at least something closer than what we've got. The relationship with #5 has changed my life. The year after he graduated, I took an English class from one of his favorite teachers during my prep period. Out of that I have gained a love for and have begun to write poetry. It is really a passion of mine now; my own high school teachers would never believe it! So the rest of the family has seen not only a change in the family dynamic with a new addition, but now this change in their mother as well. I spend hours at the computer, writing, emailing, and on these boards. The next year we had another 17 year-old foster child who has since moved on and last year an 18 year-old who needed a home. The family accepts these temporary kids, but jealousy seems to surround this permanent one. Our four sons are very close to each other. We succeeded very well in that. I guess it is like trying to break into a clique.  \n",

We discovered a few months ago that my husband has Parkinson's. I have discovered that there is at least one Parkinson's internet forum similar to this which we might need as his condition worsens. I wonder, do any of you know of any forum similar to this that you can recommend dealing with marriage issues in general? We will probably find it to be helpful also with all the other stress in our lives. Thanks for considering this and any ideas you might have.  \n",

      "Lucyjoy, You are right on, in my opinion. We don't know with what circumstances the birthparents were dealing.

Had THEY been the ones to show up in our lives when THEY were young, we might have fostered or adopted THEM.  \n",

There is a lot of good info for you here in this forum.  \n",
      "I agree that bonding is different with each child. With my bio children, something personal was the trigger. I felt the oldest move, bonded immediately after birth with #2, spotting endangered pregnancy #3, and I don't remember with #4 (Sorry Hon!). With #5, my adopted son, I bonded with him at age 17 after learning some about him but before he even moved into our home. I believe he bonded with me soon thereafter when he learned he could trust me with his stories. Go figure! I think one thing that helped in some cases is my instinct to protect them. Perhaps you will feel it kick in when the children are criticized or face some difficulty due to nothing they have done. Like a lioness defending her cubs is how I'd describe it.  \n",
      "Judilyn, Ideas from another thread come to mind. How about having your young daughter periodically write out, or dictate to you, her memories and feelings about her birthmom. You could prompt her with questions. Save them as a journal for her to add to and reread whenever necessary. Maybe she could even dictate to your 16 year-old daughter, perhaps on the computer. This might help them bond also. God bless.  \n",
      "I would like to hear from those of you who were teens or older when you were adopted. Our son came to us through foster care at 17 and left for college 6 months later. We had never discussed adoption until we had known him for about a year. It had never occurred to any of us as his birth family lives a few thousand miles away. He phones them occasionally to see that they are OK, but they have basically abandoned him. Adoption came up as an off-hand comment, and suddenly the two of us began talking about it. He would like very much for us to adopt him, wanting a family and to feel connected. I understand his feelings, but some of our four older bio sons (two married and two grandchildren) dont understand why he should need to be adopted at his age (now 19). He is three years younger than our youngest bio son and has called us ғMom and ԓDad for two years now. I love him as much as my bio sons and would adopt him right away. My husbandԒs feelings are positive but not anywhere as strong as mine, and he would like the whole family to be united on this. For now we have agreed to say we have five sons, and if anyone asks, we say one is adopted. I dont think anyone needs to know whether it is legal or not. We are trying to work through this, and I'd appreciate your reflections. Did you live with your adoptive family for a long time while waiting to be adopted? Did you talk openly about it and how did you feel? What is your relationship with asiblings like and how did it develop? Other comments?  \n",
      "My youngest came to us through foster care at 17 in the middle of his senior year. The licensing etc. process took about a month, and I felt bonded to him even BEFORE he came to our home. When he had been here only two months, I told him I loved him as much as my four bio sons. He and I have always been very close. When I have told a few select friends this, they can't believe it unless they have some adoption connection themselves. Those are more likely to accept it. I felt bonded to my bio sons as soon as I felt them move although at first I had been afraid I could never love #2 as much as #1. I guess the licensing process was like a very short pregnancy for me, and he was moving all the time!  \n",
      "I wouldn't get too uptight about the comment \"now that you are adopting, you are sure to get pregnat again!!\". It was probably just an offhand comment like saying it is sure to rain now that you have washed your car. As for the \"ugly\" comment, if you make light of it, as dreadful as it is, your stress won't rise and you may still help the grandmother see how insensitive her comment was. However, I would be inclined to confront directly someone who is not a family member with a response like, \"What should we do if the child looks like you?\" It makes the point without stabbing back, especially if said with a chuckle. A friend of mine has two daughters who as toddlers looked about as different as possible, one a blond with a fair complexion and the other black ringlets with an olive complexion. When asked if they had the same father, she paused and then replied, \"Gee, I don't remember!\" and went home laughing inside instead of tense and angry. I wish I was that quick and clever!  \n",

      "Isn't it just easier to be open about trying to have a family by whatever means? Then you can say as much or as little as you like, but it's not the stress of keeping a secret. \"Still working on it. We'll let you know when there is some news.\" Statements like that work if you are trying to conceive or adopt and allow flexibility to adapt further info to the specific questioner based on whether they are supportive or critical. They allow you to \"educate\" those who might be somewhat open about infertility treatments, foster care, adoption, reunion, whatever. I just hate secrets. Not only is there the stress of remember what has been said to whom, but also the hurt caused by \"Why didn't you ever tell me?\" Particularly if that person would have been supportive. Even though you might have disclosed the plan on a previous occasion, it is perfectly fine to say \"I don't feel like discussing it today.\"  \n",
      "Yes, you folks are right. At least I would never tell anyone I was trying to conceive!

      "Isn't this \"name calling\" somewhat like how we call our mothers-in-law? From the day I was married I chose to call mine \"Mom\", the same as I called my own mother, because I loved her and felt it would be easier to start that way than to change later and have to explain why. Now my two daughters-in-law call me \"Julie\". I don't question it. It is really the child's choice and maybe a reflection of the casual attitude of society these days where we use first names much more than last with titles. I sign gift cards to them as a couple \"Mom B\" but personal notes to the wives \"Julie\" to honor their choice. They can call me \"Noodle Noggin\" if they like. I am way more concerned about the quality of the relationship.  \n",
      "Some of you may be aware of my story which I'd be happy to summarize if necessary. At this point I am wondering how a father knows or how does it feel for him to bond with an older or teen adopted child. My husband says he does not feel the emotional connection with our former foster son, now 20 whom we met at age 17, that he feels with our bio sons, ages 23-33. He admits that he enjoys being with him very much, he really is the perfect child, and finally signs the odd email or letter \"Love, Dad\", but somehow the lack of history with him must be a problem. I bonded with this young man right away and he with me. I love him and am as committed to him as I am to our bio sons, so it is difficult for me to understand how my husband feels. We are committed to being his parents forever, but this may be one of the issues that is holding up applying for legal adoption. Can any of you, especially fathers, help me understand? Many thanks.  \n",
      "I work with teens every day and am very concerned for this child. What a confusing situation for him. I would suggest that he begin calling you and your husband Aunt and Uncle right away, if it is OK with his parents. Present the idea to him and his parents with enthusiasm. It will be a socially acceptable way for him to \"get over it\", as they suggested. This relationship with you will always be very special in his life, and you can explain it to his parents that way, but as he grows older, it will be even more confusing for him and his friends unless you help him get it straight with appropriate and socially acceptable titles. Two moms, dads, etc. is not clear to anyone for his situation. Since he is not in an abusive or neglectful situation with his parents (Or is he? Would he tell you if there is some very bad secret?), he cannot ever be your son. In his teen years he would not have to explain Aunt and Uncle to his friends except to say \"they are very special, like parents to me\", if someone asks if you are really related. I think you need to get this relationship clarified before you talk with him about bring a \"cousin\" onto the scene. When that is accomplished, I agree that shopping together would be a fun way to include him. God bless. Julie  \n",
      "Our former foster son, now 19 years old was with us for 9 months before aging out. He is now excelling in college and would like to be adopted. We have four biological sons whose ages are 31 (married with 2 year-old child), 29, 25 (married and expecting), and 22. All of these are out of our home. The older two and a wife are jealous of my (mom) relationship with new son, with whom I am very close. The younger two and a wife are very open to the idea. There is no question in anyone's mind that we are his \"forever family\", but legal adoption seems to be a stumbling block to some. Money and inheritance is not the issue as we can wait until after college which is paid for by scholarships. My husband wants total agreement by all the kids and so is holding back as well, saying \"give it time\". I understand what legal adoption would mean to this son's heart, like the commitment of marriage rather than just living together. I am impatient! Has anyone had a similar experience?  \n",
      "If you adopted them at the same time, you could say \"Yes, they are twins\" because they were \"born\" into your family at the same time. When they are older they might even enjoy this little game. Even if they weren't adopted at the same time, if it is a stranger who is asking, who cares what they think! I especially like chucknfw's response about biblical adoption. We know it is something to celebrate, so turning it into a game might make the tiresome questions more tolerable. God bless.  \n",
      "Raven, How does this sound? \"He is adopted and we are sooooo glad to have him!\" That would make him feel proud. I think if you are open about the adoption, most people will understand. If it seems like a secret, I fear your son will think it is something to hide and feel ashamed. We have an adopted son of another race which is obvious at a glance. When people become too nosey and ask questions like, \"Where are his bio parents?\" or \"Did they beat him?\" I have a stock answer. \"It just wasn't working out for him to be with them.\" If they persist, I tell them sorry, we won't talk about that with you. Only our family and closest friends know anything more about our son's past unless he chooses to tell more. He is now 20 and very proud of us! Over your son's lifetime someone will probably say something stupid to him, as you fear, but you can model responses that make him feel good and powerful rather than rejected, hurt, and insecure. God bless.  \n",
      "Once someone asked me where my child's real mother was, I said, oh my gosh, am I invisable?  I have laughed so often tonight about this response I just had to thank you! My sister was once asked by a perfect stranger if her two daughters had the same father. Her clever reply, \"Gee, I don't know!\" Oh to be quick witted!  \n",
      "There was a time for all of us when we were ignorant of what adoption entails and its impact on the different sides of the triad, and we are all still learning. Here we have the oportunity to learn from one another. I love it! dlouis, I love your response \"Why do you ask?\" It is great for any topic, and puts the responsibility for clearly communicating intent back on the questioner. Great when I can't come up with something clever on the spur of the moment. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, remembering that I was once ignorant too. Most people aren't trying to be rude. They just don't know the lingo. faith_amom, I love your quote. I've heard it before. Thanks for reminding me! Blessings to all.  \n",

      "I noticed your post a few weeks ago and am surprised to come back from vacation and see no responses. My husband and I are cc and our son is not. He came to us at 17 and is now 20. He is now proud to show the world that there are other options for families. He celebrates all the diversity to be found in his life amongst his friends and family as well as being able to pass for many ethnicities himself. I have no real suggestions for you and your daughter at her age. It seems you are doing the right things and living in a diverse neighborhood. I can only offer encouragement that one day she might even feel proud. God bless.  \n",
      "Hi dadfor2! School was out for me yesterday, so I have time again for the forum and this caught my eye. We lived in the Boston area years ago and loved it. Anyway, I teach high school math and get a few mainstreamed sped students every year in pre-algebra. I don't recall the ages of your boys, seems like about 8 and 10 (I was keeping up several months ago). While working on the very important reading skills, keep reinforcing their knowledge of math facts! Get them playing some math games like dominoes (excellent) and cards, help them figure out restaurant tips, and measure stuff. Try making scale drawings of the rooms in your new house on graph paper (big scale squares for their ages) and then figure out where to place the furniture. Teach them how to measure the furniture and talk about right angles and fractions. Have them measure the boxes you will pack in to the nearest 1/2, then 1/4 inch. No calculators at their age! Have them recite addition or multiplication facts before dessert. Tonight it is sevens! Have a nice summer!  \n",
      "Sorry, but I don't understand what your non-membership at the social worker's church has to do with whether or not you would be fit adoptive parents. Am I missing something here? I would think the social worker would have to lay that personal relationship aside. I have never heard of church attendance or membership or lack thereof having any bearing on adoption. However, as an active church member, I guess I have to nudge you gently to connect regularly with the fold! God bless, Julie  \n",
      "Six months ago my son married a woman who has never married but who has a nine year-old daughter. The birthfather is out of the picture, may even be deceased, and my son and his wife are looking into step-parent adoption. Over the last several months he has tried to get this sweet girl to call him \"Dad\", but she won't. If he were to listen to me, I would have told him him to tell her once that it is OK with him if she calls him \"Dad\" if and when she is ready and then leave the ball in her court by never mentioning it again, but he has tried to pressure her. He really does love this child from the time he met her and has a great relationship with her. So stepparents, when were you first called \"Mom\" or \"Dad\"?  \n",
      "My son is 19, but we've only known one another for 2 1/2 years. We celebrate his birthday the same as the rest of the family, and I send him a card, fancy email, or letter that comemorates the \"anniversary\" of moving in with us through foster care as it was the beginning of such a profound change in both our lives. The rest of the family, older grown children, is oblivious to the date. When my kids were little, I had a friend who wrote each child a letter on his or her birthday each year in addition to the celebration. I have always wished I had done that. I suppose it is never too late to start. Congratulations! Julie  \n",
      "How old are your kids? I would tell them everything you know about their birthparents and past in an age appropriate manner with no sugar-coating. It will resonate with their own feelings anyway no matter how old they were when removed from the home, and they will know that you are a person whom they can trust to be honest with them. I cannot tell you how much this means to my son who came to us at 17, a HS senior. He and I are well bonded and can talk about anything. He sees his bio family once a year, and I support any relationship with them that he is comfortable with while keeping his safety in mind. The more open and honest you are as they are growing up, the less you have to fear. Blessings, Julie  \n",
      "It may depend on their ages. I have fostered teens who called us by our first names one day and Mom and Dad the next. They might like to call you Mom in front of their friends like other kids do. Foster kids don't usually like to stand out. They might have to field questions if they use Aunt and Uncle. Tell them that they may decide and you will be comfortable with whatever they choose. Blessings, Julie  \n",
      "Just wanted to say I read both of your threads this morning and agree with everything monroeman has said! God bless!  \n",
      "Hi Gryph, Do you have bio kids also? If so, how have they responded to your foster kids, especially the four with whom you have an ongoing relationship? We have one whose relationship is permanent; he and I bonded right away. He came to us as a 17 y/o HS senior and was not looking for a permanent relationship, rather a safe place to finish HS and then get on with his life. Boy was he surprised! Very early I sat down with him and shared all the notes we had taken prior to meeting him from meetings and phone conversations with his SW, teachers, his boss, including any info from psychologists and doctors. There were stories from his past, those that were known to be true as well as conjectures. I think it kind of levelled the playing field so to speak. He knew it was safe to talk about any of that stuff because we had already heard a bit about it. He also knew he could trust us and it may have speeded up the bonding. Hi parentto2teens, I cannot imagine trying to live with a kid who didn't want to be here. That means both of you are miserable, and I wonder what would be the point in continuing the relationship. If you knew she was just pushing you away and then pulling to get you back, a kind of testing, that would be one thing, but this does not fit that picture. I would say let her go. You gave it your best shot. It is sad, but it takes two to do this dance. It will also be a relief.  \n",
      "I agree that you need to release the two foster kids, as heartbreaking as that may be. Consider that it is in God's plan for you to have been a temporary refuge for them while their true adoptive family was being readied. Send them off each with photos and a blessing and a willingness to correspond with them as long as they each need to be reasured by you. The younger may never contact you, but the older may want to talk on the phone or dictate a letter to new foster/adopt parent. Bless your heart. You have kept them out of harm's way, but now it is time for someone else to carry on. Mom, hubby, and your own two little angels need you.  \n",
      "I'll probably catch you-know-what for my opinion, but here goes. I applaud your compassion for the kids and desiring to give them a safe home, but what kind of message are you sending by having a live-in boyfriend? Why do you not get married? Or separate? You place the children at another disadvantage. There is not even a pretense of stability if there is no committment to marriage. Their lives have already been disrupted by parental irresponsibility and abuse. A live-in situation messes with their minds. I know I'm old-fashioned, but it's what I believe is best for adults and children. I didn't come up with this idea. I believe God designed us this way.  \n",
      "In my state (which is not yours) one can be 18 and do foster care. Where I live a foster child must have an easy exit from their bedroom in case of fire, so a basement room may or may not pass the test. You need to do as leaabc123 suggested and see if you can keep in contact with your nephew. If you can go through the training and get your license, you can do respite care for your nephew, babysit that is, while his foster parents go out for an evening or away for a weekend. Until then see if they will allow you to visit him to keep the family connection. If they allow you to visit, take them some cookies or a cake you have made for the family to enjoy, and get to know his foster parents as well. Probably most important for you is to finish high school. The best thing, besides love in your heart, that caretakers for a kid can have is a good education, so don't cheat yourself out of that. Getting your license can take some time, but it takes longer if you don't get started! I see you are a survivor yourself, of whatever got you into the system, and then of the system yourself. Look into the opportunities your state offers for further education through independent living programs. Some states offer free college or trade school tuition to kids who have aged out or the system or who were adopted after age 16, if either applies to you. God bless you for caring for your nephew.  \n",
      "Did someone mention doing the school runs with another mom and her kids also who go to the same school? Earlier I suggested a friend or neighbor, but another mom whose kids know yours would be ideal. I loved the hand-holding-chain idea also. Hope it is working out.  \n",
      "Good advice, clynn, and a good decision for you and that last little one. Victims of prolonged or severe abuse do need a lot of one-on-one attention, no matter what their age.  \n",
      "Where are they getting the matches, lighters, or lighter fluid with which to start a fire? Those items should be locked up and out of access of any children in your home now that you know there is a problem. You must calmly and matter of factly explain the dangers and consequences, and until this activity is well behind them, your children should not be left unsupervised.  \n",
      "Since he is already in a foster home, it would require a legal move. Do you know the women? If they and the child are agreeable to the move, a court might agree also based on the school and friends rationale. That is a really big if. We did it in 3 weeks to get a specific child, but the state was going to move him because transporting him to his school was a big expense and time committment for them. It might not have happened if the status quo had not already been an inconvenience for the state. Along with Diane I also recommend you start the process right away. If you can drive the paperwork around town to the different agencies for the required signatures, etc. that can save some time, but the bottom line is getting the license. God bless.  \n",
      "This is horrifying to read about when there are over 500,000 kids languishing in group homes or moving in and out of foster homes for \"lack\" of adoptive families. It is a national tragedy. Your story, and countless others, certainly make one wonder what hoops one has to go through to become such an efficient and compassionate social worker. We got our FP license in less than 3 weeks but we did it to get a specific 17 y/o, \"hard-to-place\" male who is a total delight and honestly a perfect child. He is 20 now, and we will probably adopt him as an adult, which, I have heard, is a piece of cake, nothing compared to what you are going through. Makes me wonder if fostering a kid until they are an adult isn't the way to go. Ridiculous, I know, but it seems from the horror stories one hears about some foster parents is that having a pulse is the only requirement. The entire system certainly needs an overhaul. I think writing the governor with copies to all government officials, newspapers, editorials and the media is an excellent idea, but it sounds like you ought to have someone who is a complete stranger to you write it in third person. My heart goes out to you.  \n",
      "We became foster parents specifically to get a 17 year-old stranger 3 months before high school graduation. We are now his parents and he a wonderful son. The process took about 3 weeks 3 years ago. We drove the paperwork all over town ourselves to expedite matters rather than rely on mail service. Since foster parents willing to take older teens are such a rare commodity and no one else seems interested in taking this young man, I should think you will have no problem. Sadly, it will free up his bed for another, and for that the state ought to be grateful. God bless.  \n",
      "I don't know about your state, but my husband and I became foster parents so that we could take a particular 17 year-old. We were in contact with his SW from the beginning, so everyone had the same goal. We rushed through everything and drove the paperwork around town rather than rely on the post office to speed things up. Since this child is not in the system and I assume you are not related, it might be a good idea to pose the theoretical situation to a SW. Best wishes and God bless.  \n",
      "Some brief advice is to give him as much physical contact as possible. Stories on your lap, lots of hugs, hand holding, cuddles and as much attention as you possibly have time for. He may eventually come around to a normal appetite, but it may take a while. Add dry milk for calcium and dried fruit for iron to home made cookies and bars. Dry cereals can boost vitamins and minerals, with or without milk. Read the labels. Blessings, Julie  \n",
      "I have fostered teens. They usually call you by your first name, unless there is no hope of reunification. Then they might call you Mom and Dad or Aunt and Uncle or most anything to which you agree. Their friends usually know you are their foster parents, not their bio parents, and that they are with you because it is not possible for them to live at home. The age difference isn't the issue. You are offering a safe home, reasonable authority and boundaries, a place where they can do homework, a listening ear, and compassionate heart. With teens, you need to be on top of all the time outside of school, and all the various activities. Blessings, Jullie  \n",
      "Ditto on the hold, rock, cuddle, and sing. It's THE single most important part of parenting - CONTACT! Let the dust bunnies multiply, the weeds grow, and eat fast food or out of cans for a while! Have fun and enjoy each other. God bless!  \n",
      "Make some time to volunteer at your local school or a day care facility or church nursery. Offer to babysit for a neighbor or family member for a weekend. Here is a funny I was sent of which your posts reminded me even though you are thinking of older kids. Enjoy! Preparation for Parenthood =========================== Preparation for parenthood is not just a matter of reading books and decorating the nursery. Here are 12 simple tests for expectant parents to take to prepare themselves for the real- life experience of being a mother or father. 1. Go to the local drug store, tip the contents of your wallet on the counter, and tell the pharmacist to help himself. Then go to the supermarket. Arrange to have your salary paid directly to their head office. Go home. Pick up the paper. Read it for the last time. 2. Before you finally go ahead and have (or adopt) children, find a couple who are already parents and berate them about their methods of discipline, lack of patience, appallingly low tolerance levels, and how they have allowed their children to run riot. Suggest ways in which they might improve their child's sleeping habits, toilet training, table manners and overall behavior. Enjoy it - - it'll be the last time in your life that you will have all the answers. 3. To discover how the nights will feel, walk around the living room from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. carrying a wet bag weighing approximately 8-12 lbs. At 10 p.m. put the bag down, set the alarm for midnight, and go to sleep. Get up at 12 and walk around the living room again, with the bag, till 1 a.m. Put the alarm on for 3 a.m. As you can't get back to sleep get up at 2 a.m. and make a drink. Go to bed at 2:45 a.m. Get up again at 3 a.m. when the alarm goes off. Sing songs in the dark until 4 a.m. Put the alarm on for 5 a.m. Get up. Make breakfast. Keep this up for 5 years. Look cheerful. 4. Can you stand the mess children make? To find out, smear peanut butter onto the sofa and jam onto the curtains. Hide a fish finger behind the stereo and leave it there all summer. Stick your fingers in the flowerbeds then rub them on the clean walls. Cover the stains with crayons. How does that look? 5. Dressing small children is not as easy as it seems: first buy an octopus and a string bag. Attempt to put the octopus into the string bag so that none of the arms hang out. Time allowed for this: all morning. 6. Take an egg carton. Using a pair of scissors and a pot of paint, turn it into an alligator. Now take a toilet tube. Using only scotch tape and a piece of foil, turn it into a Christmas cracker. Last, take a milk container, a ping pong ball, and an empty packet of Coco Pops and make an exact replica of the Eiffel Tower. Congratulations. You have just qualified for a place on the playgroup committee. 7. Forget the Miata and buy a Taurus. And don't think you can leave it out in the driveway spotless and shining. Family cars don't look like that. Buy a chocolate ice cream bar and put it in the glove compartment. Leave it there. Get a quarter. Stick it in the cassette player. Take a family-size packet of chocolate cookies. Mash them down the back seats. Run a garden rake along both sides of the car. There. Perfect. 8. Get ready to go out. Wait outside the toilet for half an hour. Go out the front door. Come in again. Go out. Come back in. Go out again. Walk down the front path. Walk back up it. Walk down it again. Walk very slowly down the road for 5 minutes. Stop to inspect minutely every cigarette end, piece of used chewing gum, dirty tissue and dead insect along the way. Retrace your steps. Scream that you've had as much as you can stand, until the neighbors come out and stare at you. Give up and go back into the house. You are now just about ready to try taking a small child for a walk. 9. Always repeat everything you say at least five times. 10. Go to your local supermarket. Take with you the nearest thing you can find to a pre-school child -- a fully grown goat is excellent. If you intend to have more than one child, take more than one goat. Buy your week's groceries without letting the goats out of your sight. Pay for everything the goats eat or destroy. Until you can easily accomplish this do not even contemplate having children. 11. Hollow out a melon. Make a small hole in the side. Suspend it from the ceiling and swing it from side to side. Now get a bowl of soggy Weetabix and attempt to spoon it into the swaying melon by pretending to be an airplane. Continue until half the Weetabix is gone. Tip the rest into your lap, making sure that a lot of it falls on the floor. You are now ready to feed a 12-month-old baby. 12. Learn the names of every character from Postman Pat, Fireman Sam and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. When you find yourself singing \"Postman Pat\" at work, you finally qualify as a parent.  \n",

      "Hi! I am AA and my Hubby is CC...our 3 kids are somewhere in between and it would take 2 boxes of Crayola's to describe our 6 grandkids....:confused: My point is we're all over the scale and while I can ignore the stares I refuse to over-look rude insensitive comments, especially from those providing a service for which I'm expected to pay. I, like another poster, am fond of *turning the tables* and asking simply \"What makes you ask that?\" I've had comments made about my marriage from perfect strangers that have left me scratching my head. Once while seated at IHOP two AA females across the isle leaned over to say \"Girlfriend, I don't blame you...they take all of our men its time we fought back!\" They acted as if this was a marriage of revenge not simply an act of love.  What really burns my britches is when people ( strangers) will see me with my bi-racial grandkids and my brothers AA grandkids and come up and say how beautiful/cute/lovely etc. the bi-racial ones are and totally ignore the AA child(ren). Interestingly these comments usually come from the AA community. The point is ALL kids are beautiful. I don't expect people to be color blind, just sensible...Hang in there...MissyM :)  \n",
      "Originally posted by mae5  Missy M, I guess in this answer i kind of contradict myself. I am open to all races, and i have been that way, i respect everyones culture and I love to learn about them. But I have avoided being in a relationship with a black male. Not because i am not attracted to them. I have found many attractive but growing up my black side told me only to date a black male, they resented the white in me, guess i should note, i was adopted by my grandmother on my black side. So in a way I think i avoid being in a relationship with a black male due to rebellion. However, as of now I am engaged to a man that is Assyrian, which is his culture, and he was born in Greece.  I don't think you're contridicting yourself at all...I think you simply are enjoying your preference as we all do. I am Black and married to a White man; I never considered dating outside of my race, but we basically started out as friends and love grew...Our kids have varied veiws too. My oldest daughter's husband is White, our youngest daughter has dated both races and her daughters dad is also bi-racial and our son seems to attract both but is most often seen with white girls...( he's playa playa :rolleyes: ). I was curious; thanks for answering.   KVK: IMO my kids didn't actually become aware that they were \"different\" until they went off to school. When our oldest was about 6 she asked why her cousin Patti ( my brothers child, AA) was so black? I explained that Uncle Bo and Aunt Pam were both Black so their kids were Black too; but since Mommy was Black and Daddy was White our kids were lighter. Later that same day we bought paint and mixed it so she could \"see\" how colors change other colors when mixed together.  My biggest pet peeve was having others (mostly AA) point out how beautiful our kids were while ignoring my IMO equally as beautiful AA neice or nephew! BTW: As long as you make sure you are proud of his culture and you are willing to bring the AA parts of it home with books, toys, music, art, movies and AA/CC friends there is no reason why you should even consider moving.

      "Hi Marybelle...I hope you'll forgive me for intruding as I am not an A-parent; I am a B-mom who happens to be AA and married to a CC male; together we have 3 kids all grown and in addition I have a placed daughter who is also AA ( different dad). I also have a 16 year old grandson who very much identifies with and participates in the low riding jeans, Rap music (:confused: ) Hip Hop culture and style of today. Its true that that particular sector tosses the *N* word around like its nothing but in our family its not acceptable or allowed.  Its disrespectful and demeaning to all of us and I will not have it spoken in my presence. I am not bashing anyone but I want to address this statement:   I'm not even convinced that it's all an adoption thing, the cultural part factors in, but they are YOUR kids and they are saying and doing what teenagers in their world do, right? Everything I know about teenagers says, there is almost always a communication gap beween the generations - sounds to me like your kids are including you in their world, and that the gap is less than what many bio parents experience.    When you hear racial slurs and jokes and don't denounce them as wrong even when you feel they are, you become part of the problem. This is not simply part of a generational gap. My family of origin is AA and my parents did not allow it either. Its not about what everyone else is doing either; thats the oldest con in the world. Its about what you will and won't tolerate in your home. The Hip Hop Rap world is infamous for smoking marijuana and disrespecting females and authority figures in general too, but just as you wouldn't tolerate these things in your home you shouldn't tolerate anything that makes YOU, the PARENT, uncomfortable. It doesn't matter if you are the B- A- Step- or Foster parent, your job is to teach them what is appropriate and acceptable; its not about what Emniem and P-Diddy are saying. They should not be allowed to be role models for your kids. Your being CC or her being AA isn't the issue IMO; she is your daughter so she needs to follow your rules. It doesn't sound to me as if she is \"including\" you in her world, if anything by using a term that makes you uncomfortable and that she knows you wouldn't use, she is Excluding you. She is testing the limits with you; as a teen thats her job; as a Parent your job is to set the limits and stop her in her tracks.  As far as \"all AA's doing that its not true; many of us deplore that term as we should. Its just as degrading now as it was then and even if its being used by AA's to AA's its still wrong. Its OK for you the parent to lay down the law and forbid it.  My grandson knows not to use that word; when I come over the jeans are instantly hiked back up, the hats and scarves come off and the volume of the Rap is turned down. I wouldn't dare speak to what he does behind my back but I demand that he be respectful in my home and in my presence.  I am not speaking badly of your parenting style; I understand the unique posistion this term puts you in and thats why as a AA woman I am giving my advice so strongly. You posted this question because your gut instinct is telling you its wrong...follow that feeling. Getting off soapbox now...:o MissyM  \n",
      " \"So I may not have the understanding that you do but Thanks for coming along and giving the advice that you did.\"  I think you do indeed have the same level of understanding that I do and you expressed it beautifully...MissyM  \n",
      " \"Please understand, I am quite clear that most African-Americans find this word offensive what I said is that my two kids have only ever heard the N word from other African-Americans. I don֒t for a minute think that the people theyve heard it from are MOST African Americans. But they donҒt hear it from whites, so thay have not identified it with white racism. Just like my white friends, none of my Black friends find it acceptable -- trouble is, my kids arent real interested in my friendsҒ opinions, theyre focused on their generation and like it or not their friends are not offended. I know there are kids out their that feel as you and I do, but my kids arenҒt hanging with them. \"  Oh Marybell...I didn't mean to imply that you felt most of \"us\" toss that word around; heck I am a fast thinker and a slow typer. My sentence was incomplete; I should have posted \"don't let her make you think that its OK since all AA's use this word. Clearly its a \"teen thing.\" My grandson probably does use it too, but in my presence its not allowed. I have BTW overheard him use the *b* word to describe a female while on the phone and immediately I made him get off the phone and explain why he thought so low of women. His reply...\"Grammy, I don't, its just the way me and my dogs talk, I didn't see you come upstairs and I am sorry you heard me say that. \" Am I naive enough to think he stopped using that term??? Heck no, but at 5 foot 2 I am bold enough to make sure that he at 5 feet 11 inches won't let me hear him use it. IMO I could care less about the (legal, safe) behavior that he and his 'dogs\" engage in behind my back, he needs to \"fit in\"; BUT he has to respect something and even if its not himself its gonna be me. As a teen I had a potty mouth behind my parents back but in our home I was an Angel. My point is IMO you have every right to set the limits in your home. If her uncles insist on talking that way and she can't resist the urge to do it in your presence then she need to be punished. I am not advocating stopping the visits; if she were 4 or 5 and had this problem I would; but she is old enough to know that certain behaviors are unacceptable in front of you. She needs to exercize self control or suffer the consequences. If she can't prevent you from hearing offensive words while she's on the phone either by not saying them or by saying them in a low tone then she looses the phone privelege. This isn't a word she simply must must use in order to speak to her friends, she has choices...I assure you she isn't using them in Math class where the teacher will overhear her.  Mary, I understand that you have an added deminsion that I haven't had to contend with; I don't envy your posistion!:( My answer was meant to convey that as a Black woman I don't tolerate this in my home and its OK for you to refuse to do it too. You don't owe her the right to disrespect you simply because others are fine with it. Hip Hop is also comfortable with the term *Ho* to describe women; and you wouldn't except that so don't feel you have to accept this word.  BTW: as a Black woman who married a White man back in the 70's, I will also say that never ever have I heard that word from a member of my White family. Its ONLY been other AA's that I've heard it from so it never was a racial comment, it was an insulting stupid comment. Its used in a \"joking\" manner but IMO it isn't funny.  I feel your pain Honey and I hope you'll find a way to get it out of your way so that you can focus on the \"good\" things about raising teens, like sex, and make-up, and taking your car and.... :eek: :eek: LOL...Good Luck...MissyM  \n",
      "Will they fit in? **Yes, not only are children amazingly accepting of their peers but they simply don't see color differences as adults do. Of course not everyone will; but thats where family love and support comes in.  Will they be given a hard time from other children? **Probably not; any person who has ever looked at TV or been in a grocery store knows that people come in a variety of colors and shades. These are a couple of the many questions going through my mind. Are we doing them an injustice by raising them in a white family and white community? **Despite what you may think, its likely you aren't. There simply aren't very many \"all-white\" communities left anywhere. You will also have the option of going outside your community and exposing them to different people, ideas, cultures, foods, etc. You are only limited by your imagination; visit other places where \"white\" isn't the only visible color. I love these children already and I know that we will do our best to give them everything they need. **What they need is what you are offering: parents who love them enough to give them all that they need. Their needs include parents who embrace their culture. As long as you are doing your best, nothing that occurs outside your door will be too problematic to overcome. ****BTW: I am 1/2 of a bi-racial marriage team; we have 3 kids together and I have one AA daughter that I am now reunited with; all grown now. Of couse they faced racism at times; its still alive and well in America; we just refused to let it live and fester in our home. We didn't dwell on the negatives but we did deal with them head on as they occurred. We taught them to be proud of who they were and who each of us were. We embrace both sides of their heritage. We had love, just as you do and it was enough...Best Wishes, MissyM   \n",
      "As far as role models go, I never needed any rold models of my own race. My mom provided me with most of my cultural knowledge, by teaching me about my different ethnic cultures. My real culture, though, is the Canadian culture. I am Christian, and celebrate the Christian holidays. Heck, I am more \"Native\" than my bmom is, and she has more native blood than I do! lol My asister, on the other hand, sought out friends who were AA in her teen years, and identified with them more than with the rest of our family. Each child will be different, and I guess there is no real way to know. Just give your children opportunities to learn about their biological heritage, but don't forget that they are living in your world!   Allabout: As the mother of 3 bi-racial kids and one AA daughter reunited for 2 years, I applaud your insight and post! It is so very refreshing to see \"I never needed role models of my own race.\" I think you've touched upon something very important, at least to me.  I am AA. my husband is CC, my placed daughter is also AA and the others are bi-racial. If you look at it for what it is, our kids never had actual same race role models either. It never mattered that they met someone they could identify with, we taught them that they were each uniquely and devinely formed; they weren't CC, Dad is, they aren't AA, Mom is,they were an awesome combination of US...  Interestingly we discovered if left alone they would all find there comfort zone, and they did! My son is engaged to an AA/CC lady and they have a 2month old daughter; our oldest married a CC male and they have 2 kids. Our middle daughter has an AA/CC Hispanic/CC daughter, my reunited daughter has 2 AA kids; and our home is called the Rainbow Coalition.  I just posted to say I also don't think its necessary to adopt a 2nd child of \"like\" color to support the 1st. Kids are just so open and loving. If you give them love and honor their heritage at home, they will do just fine away from home. Best Wishes...MissyM  \n",
      "Originally posted by bellazmama  I recently went back to work. My new office is evenly mixed, Black and White (although mostly women). Several Black women came up to my desk in the first several days I was there and asked if my daughter was Mixed. I'd heard that a couple of times before, but began to realize that this is the term most used by the Black community. She will be seen as another shade of beautiful! Whether cappuccino or espresso or cafe ole, brown babies are gorgeous! Sarah  Sarah...your daughters impression of who and what she is will come from you, no matter what the world sees when they see them. I am Black, my hubby is White; our 3 kids are bi-racial in our hearts and our home. They will not list themselves as Black, to do so would be to negate or deny their Dad's imput in their lives...ditto for calling themselves White, that would be a denial of my contributions. They are bi-racial of 2 races, and we've taught them to tightly embrace and be proud of both.  I understand that its common in the Black community to use the term \"mixed\" and if in passing conversation they might allow themselves to be described as such, but if you stop them and ask they will say what they were raised to believe....they are bi-racial. Years ago the term \"mixed\" was often followed by the word \"breed\" and was very derogotory; even if its used differently today, we simply prefer bi-racial. Never in a zillion years would they do the Halle Berry thing and declare themselves Black...or White for that matter.  \n",
      "Originally posted by Jeanne21  Here is a quote from an adoption agency, known as \"Adoption-Link, Inc.\" that deal only with African-American, bi-racial and multi-racial children: \"Adoption-Link does not allow families to specify the racial heritage of a child. In our society even part-African-American persons are considered African-American and this heritage needs to be acknowledged and celebrated.\" I think this points out that bi-racial children, although having parents of two different races, are considered African-American. If you do not acknowledge this, you are doing your \"bi-racial\" child harm.  Well in the state of Texas the race of the father is put on the birth certificate....ergo even though I am the color of OPRAH as were my parents and siblings, my kids are all listed as Caucasian! My son has a 6 week old daughter, he is bi-racial, his girlfriend, the baby's mom is Black...however since he is listed as Caucasion, so is the baby....whose skin, BTW is the color of ebony. Go figure.  \n",

      "Hi Katie... Welcome aboard! I am glad that you have reached a decision that you are comfortable with. As a birthmom I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. I posted not to offer you the advice you were looking for but another \"heads up.\" In this forum and in many other cases we (birthmothers ) prefer that you not call us by the initials that you posted. If you'll notice, whenever you post them they come out as ** as opposed to something flushable....  I know that as a new member you probably weren't aware of this and believe me I am not bashing you at all; I just wanted to make sure you were as aware of this issue as are some of the other members who've been here for a while. Take Care and Good Luck....MissyM  \n",
      "Regarding the above post, as someone who attempted to offer feedback with such limited information, its difficult to understand your anger. If you go back and read your first post you should clearly see that the details you are giving now puts a whole new spin on the situation. I am not saying you should post ALL of the details here but IMHO, when you simply ask if you should end contact with a b-family without giving an obvious reason except to post that you are tired, you feel like you're \"reporting\" or that friends are advising you to, you mislead us and it move us in a direction that we otherwise would not go.  I wish you could experience one hour in a b-moms shoes; the last thing you'd ever want to say is that someone should close whatever door thats even partialy open between an adoptee and that b-mom UNLESS IT WOULD HARM THE CHILD(REN) TO NOT DO SO. I don't know your situation at all, I only have what you post to guide me. Just b/c you posted it a certain way doesn't mean I'll read it that way. My advice and comments are given freely and you can take from my comments what you want and kick the rest to the curb. Something I've had to learn is that comments made here aren't directly related to me or my situation b/c nobody actually knows me here. It isn't personal unless I let it be.  I am a birthmom, a mom who has raised 3 kids into adulthood, and now a grandmother of 7. I would no more advise you to put your children in danger than I'd put my own in danger; but sitting here in the comfort of my cozy den sipping a tall latte, I have no clue as to what danger your situation involves. Its like calling 911 from a cell phone and saying come and rescue me and hanging up. I'd love to help but without the appropriate information I am unable to. As far as you being their mother on behalf of most of the b-moms I know please hear me say that when we place our children with you we WANT and NEED you to be MOMMY in every sense of the word. We have absolutely no desire to feel that our kids aren't loved and accepted by you as a part of you, or are simply sitting there waiting on Mommy to return. I wanted my daughters mom to be willing to die and kill for her; I prayed she'd forget she didn't give birth to this child. I don't know if you know my story but my daughter was raised 2 doors away from me and I denied myself and stepped back to allow them to be a family. Its what I wanted for her and why I placed her in the first place. To this very day 2 years after reuniting I still refer to her a-mom as her Mother, even though I gave birth to her and she now calls me Mommie too.  Recently it seems that a lot of posters have come to the boards seeking advice and when its given the posters slap you in the face for trying if you aren't saying exactly what they want to hear and probably already know, anyway...I don't get it. This isn't a therapy session and I am not a professional. Perhaps its time to step back from trying to support....MissyM  \n",
      "I never said you should let them read their case file. I did say you need to tell them the truth, over time, in an age appropriate way so that they do not learn the truth all at once at the age of 18. They need to know that their birthmom made some very bad choices. They need to know this because it effects them and it is, in part, their story too.  IMHO Kids need to know \"why\" they were removed from their birth-famlies simply to avoid having them fear they will at some point be taken from you. I have an Aunt who adopted identical twin boys from the foster care system at age 5. These boys were in 3 foster homes before coming to her, one of the foster homes was also abusive. Even after being there with her for years they had this fear that they'd be taken away from her also UNTIL she explained the \"why's\" of their removal from their family. My daughter is a social worker who explained how awful it is to remove kids in the middle of the night and not be able -by law- to explain exactly why. (Since they could be called to testify someday she can't discuss it with them; she can only listen and generalize.) If these kids have been in this situation for a lifetime they don't know why its a cause for seperation NOW. Its very much up to the parents to share info with them.  \n",
      "Originally posted by amom4life  I was never involved with this thread but I read through it today thinking it wasa lively discussion about a specific scripture. Well, I found it was far from it and I wonder why certain people want to get it all started up again? Bored? Nothing better to do? This thread was in part productive but mostly it was not. I'm ashamed that this thread even exists on the Christian forum! Not because of the orginal post but because of what happened after. Bashing each other like this is not the example Christ would have us as Christians set nor is it pleasing to God. God says: we will be know as Christians by our love for one another. That is not evident here. I too Like D.Louis very much and appreciate her thoughts, insight, gracious spirit and compassion anywhere on these boards. Momto1 is right when she says if we lose D.Louis it will be our loss! Also Judilyn just said today that she doesn't remember why she was hurt by this thread but she knows it's the reason she doesn't come around more. Also our loss. Why can't we just let this thread that was hurtful to so many go?? I saw that many people apologized to each other and for the most part it was over the confusion in this thread by misunderstandings, deleted posts, and edited posts. Do we really need to go here again?? Judy  Yep, AMom.....I will admit I was kinda bored today, its cold and rainy and I have the flu, my d/h is in Aspen on the slopes, however there are other things I could be doing, not really better but certainly \"other\". There are Christmas thank you cards to be sent, checkbooks to balance, payroll at the clinic to reveiw, a birthday party to be planned for a grandchild etc. so I did have better things to do. HOWEVER I made the choice to sit down at my computer having been away for 5 months and search my name for some of the threads and posts that I'd missed while away. While doing that I came across this thread in which another Christian, much like yourself trounced all over not only my post but me in the process; I felt anger, hurt, and yes, the need to go here so I responded and ventilated my feelings about her post which is what I mistakenly felt this forum was for. I didn't even know there was a time limit on reading and responding to old posts. I guess the rules over here are different... I never meant to be unpleasing to God; I thank you for pointing out His feelings to me. BTW: I've given my reasons for responding, may I ask what yours were? Are you perhaps the Christian Police? I guess \"certain people\" have rights that others haven't obtained yet.  Anyway I apologize for posting here in your forum. I never meant to make you or anyone else uncomfortable; you guys all stay please... I'll stay away until you feel I've obtained the proper level of \"Christianity\" and when my thoughts mirror yours, I'll come back.....Missy M ps>>>you are welcome to the boards I frequent anytime.

I think its gonna be my reason too!....BTW: thanks to those of you who took the time to read my original post, saw my feelings and supported me through them. I needed that. Missy M  \n",
      "Originally posted by amom4life  Missy, I was not attacking you personally so I really don't understand the false accusations you are spewing at me or the anger. I said certain PEOPLE not certain PERSON. I'm not the Christian police or any other kind of police. My statement that the bashing of each other is not pleasing to God is a TRUE statement. I find what is pleasing to God or not from His word. Bashing others is never pleasing to God and not how He expects His children to treat one another or to treat those who aren't Christian for that matter. You ask what my purpose for responding to this thread was...because after reading it through I didn't see it as a good idea to dreadge up all this old stuff seeing what happened the first time this thread was alive. In other words hoping that what happened before wouldn't happen again. Trying to keep the peace so to speak. Judy  You are right Judy...I was angry and I intentionally lashed out at you simply because YOU responded. The post I wrote was meant for Melody. As I said I've been away for over 5 months and yesterday was the first time I saw her post about me because in my opinion, it was personal. You say in the quoted post ... \" I'm not upset or angry with anyone I just don't see a good purpose for bringing this particular thread back to life. Unless to discuss what the orginal poster intended before it got all heated with all the misunderstandings and confusion.\" Thats your posistion on the matter and I respect that; I just don't share it. I was upset and that was reason enough for me to address it. You say: \" I just don't see the point of starting up a thread again that ended up so hurtful and unproductive. I never said that I felt you shouldn't share your feelings and I NEVER said you weren't welcome to post here nor have I EVER claimed this as my forum. I really hate it when people put words in my mouth that I never said or even thought.\" Now on that point Judy we agree whole heartedly. The passion that led you to address my post when you felt I did that to you was exactly what I felt about her post and why I responded to it. It had nothing what so ever to do with trying to dreadge up anything; in fact with all the deleting and apologizing I never read the whole thread because it became difficult to follow. Just as you didn't follow the path of the original poster and only responded to my post; so did I. I'm sure you weren't trying to open a can of ugliness either....and so far we haven't. I apologize for attacking you. I thank you for not counter attacking....I already know you'll forgive me...I can tell, so thank you in advance.  Ya know Judy, I said I wouldn't post here again and I did so only to apologize to you. I haven't ever been in the company of Christians and felt so unwelcome before. (I didn't feel that from you). In case you're wondering I am also a Christian.  I never thought I'd have someone say I should stay on my side of the boards; the b-mom side.... and it hurt. I know prejudice intimately Black woman, born in the mid-50's raised for 14 years in the south; married to White man) and thanks to Melody I know it still exsists...I just didn't expect to find it here.

The pain for the mother was be strong, but that is something that was decided when she gave him away, and she needs to live with her situation. IMO these parents have to live with the situation that developed when they adopted within their family too. That means that the B-parents will have information that ordinary adoptions whether open or closed wouldn't normally have. While the b-mom does indeed have to live with her decision, adoption isn't an event; its a journey and its gonna take time to get it right.

      "Hi CLJ ! Wow, what a heartbreaking story; thank you for sharing it. I am a reunited birthmom so my thoughts might not be exactly what you are looking for, but I want you to know that I mean you no disrespect.  You say in your post that you and your sister have had no real contact in many years and that your Mom is the only one who really has seen her / them on a regular basis. Because of this IMO if I were in your shoes and in spite of the fact that the child is \"blood,\" I'd consider leaving him in his current foster home. If he is 5 years old and he's been in this F-home for the past 3 years he is most likely firmly bonded to these parents. Its seems cruel to take him away simply because he is related, especially since he doesn't know you. Have you had any type of contact with since he's been in this home? Is there a reason why you didn't seek custody when he was removed from your sister's home , even if it were to be on a temporary basis? Have you considered what effect this will have on your sister and his siblings? Your post seems to indicate that your relationship with her is \"rocky\" how will it effect the child to see her on occassions when families get together, ie: Xmas, funerals etc?  I mean you no disrespect, I just don't know if removing him at this stage of the game is best for him. I'd say there is a lot you need to consider other than he's a relative....  I can understand your desire to keep him in your family and I commend you for wanting to do this, I just think there are other things to consider and it all comes down to whats best for the child. Is it possible for you to become intergrated into his foster family and get to know him as a nephew? What about her other kids, his sibslings are you in contact with them too? I'd say maybe in HIS best interest you should consider what moving him will do to him. JMO....MissyM  \n",
      "Originally posted by gela  MissyM - I can't speak for anyone but myself. My dh and I are an interracial couple. We would have gladly accepted a child of any race and our agency was aware of that. We were matched with a CC bmother and the race of the bfather was unknown. No one knew what race our baby would be until he was born. After his birth, it was clear he was CC. There was no way we were going to change our minds simply because he was CC. We would no more do that than turn down a baby simply bc he was AA. When I told the original poster it could happen, this was not making a value judgement as if it was good, bad, better, worse, etc. I was just making a factual observation. I'm AA and I am the mother of a full CC baby. I'm not sure if this will help you to \"get it\" but I do hope it helps you understand why I as an AA adopted a full CC baby.  Gela...my post wasn't meant to critisize you or your situation at all. In fact your situation is one I understand and support fully. You did not go in looking for a Caucasian child specifically.  BTW: My d/h and I are also an interracial couple with bi-racial kids together and I also am the b-mom to an AA daughter. One question if I may, how are your relatives handling the adoption? My father had an issue with my marriage AT FIRST but grew to see why I married the man I married. My kids were his first gr.kids so it wouldn't have mattered if they were pinstripped! He spoiled them rotten. I had / have relatives who either frowned over my kids when they were younger (all are grown now) or pointed out how lucky they were to have \"good\" hair, wonderful skin tones, grey eyes blah blah blah....it stunk!

She of course had reservations b/c we were young and unmarried when our 1st child was born but she never gave me any indication that my race was an issue for her.

The day his will was read his grand mother put a LARGE sum of money in a trust fund for him and another for our daughter.  When my daughter was born his 22 year old sister came to the hospital and upon seeing her declared \"Well its OK you can't even tell she's half Black\"....My d/h replied yeah but we plan on telling everyone anyway.

      "Hi Brat...mea culpa; guilty as charged! Looking back over my 1st post I did indeed *overlook* the basic fact that people do indeed adopt AA kids for reasons other than they are there. Actually I meant to word it differently. {ROFL}  I completely understand your desire to adopt a bi-racial baby. I think if my hubby and I were adopting thats what I'd feel also. Despite what many say the world isn't color blind...yet. I still get strange looks when I'm out and about with my d/h; this after 28 years of marriage. BTW: My oldest brother is married to a Caucasian woman and he doesn't get the \"stares\" that I get. (only glances) Its more accepted for him to be a Black man with a White wife than for me to be a Black woman with a White husband...go figure.  I completely understand Gela's posistion too; I simply don't get why a person would want to subject a child to this predictament unnecessarily and if a Black couple enters the room with a White child, heads will turn and folks will gasp.

Its OK I had completly forgotten about this thread until tonight. Hope your drama turns out alright and know that I'm only a *pm* away if you need me...Take Care...MissyM  \n",

      "I just had to post and say what a wonderful idea this thread is...I hope it never ends. The tears are flowing down my cheeks! :)  This is a sorta on-topic- but- not -post, OK? I am a coming to grips with the fact that my husband and I are having a late-in-life unplanned pregnancy...some days I struggle with finding a reason to smile, and most days I loose the fight. Yesterday I recieved flowers from him with a card that read \" Thirty years ago I knew I wanted you to become my wife and have my babies....thirty years and 3 kids later I've become wiser and that feeling is more intense now than ever; thank you for making it grow, again.\" I found the reason to smile...MissyM:)  \n",
      "Yep, Melody you read it right; I'm pregnant, almost 20 years after my d/h had a vasectomy and 22 years after the last child! We are entering week 14 and things are moving along beautifully. Its unplanned but not unwelcomed; it just took a moment to get used to the idea.  Not only is God amazing BUT He also has a sense of humor; here we were looking forward to retirement and He says uh-uh you Guys are not done yet! Please pray for us during this critical time and know that I am praying for you too. MissyM:)  \n",
      " \"Yes, \"Z\"s mom does have a major influence over \"Z\"s decision to place the baby. She does all the talking for \"Z\". She has really pushed for the adoption plan the entire pregnancy. We know that \"Z\" would keep the baby if her mother would allow. This really is sad, but in the best interest of the baby. As a single parent, \"Z\"s mother works several jobs and is never home.\"  My heart goes out to you in this very emotional and heartbreaking moment. I read your post over and over and I captured the part that I couldn't get past. You state the Z's mom does all the talking for her and that its she who is pushing for the adoption. You go on to say \"We know that ~Z~ would keep the baby if her mother would allow.\"  I posted to say that the decision to parent or place is Z's and Z's alone to make. Its not based on who the family breadwinner is, how rich/poor she is, how vocal her Mom is or even how destructive Z's past behaviors were. If she hasn't done anything to place this baby in harms way then her past adolescent behavior should not be used against her now. Anyone is capable of change; especially teenagers. Heck at 17 I wasn't the \"lady\" I am today. I was motivated to change when I realized where my behavior had landed me. I was ~Z~ once....  I apologize for being a nay sayer here but IMO Z's mom is making a decision that isn't hers to make, anymore than its mine to make. You are aiding her by having so much love for the baby. What would ~Z's~ mom do if you were out of the picture? If you  know in your heart that this young Mom wants to parent her child and is being pushed by her Mom to do otherwise then you should ask yourself if you truly want to be a part of that? If you substituted the word \"boyfriend\" or cousin, or pimp, postman, or surfer buddies instead of \"~Z's~ Mom\" as the person who is pushing her to place, you'd probably gather a whole different reaction in this thread. There can be no happy/healthy outcome for her (Z) with this adoption if she is being forced to place simply to apease her mother. Its the wrong way to go about it and as much as you love this baby adopting her just does not seem right unless the MOTHER herself is positively certain she wants to place her.  JMO...MissyM  \n",
      "KcMomma posted: ~Bmoms are allowing you to take care of the baby that they knew that could not do themselves. RESPECT ~ As a reunited B-mom let me emphatically state that I never \"allowed anyone to  take care of the baby that I myself couldn't take care of.\" I wish you would kindly refrain form posting as if you are speaking for all B-moms. I gave my daughter the opportunity to have loving mature parents to ~raise her~...not take care of BUT raise for life. You speak as if they were simply daycare attendants and they most certainly were not. I feel Blessed6 has every right to peer into the window of this P-Bmoms life; she was invited in when they selected her family to adopt...not wait and see BUT adopt this baby; she is in a holding pattern with a child that might someday be going there to live and again, she isn't simply a daycare provider. She has given no indication of being judgemental or even that she is attempting to sway the Mom in any way. She is more than gracious, much more than I might be in this situation, in fact. I admire the strength and maturity it takes to even be in her shoes and the fact that she came here and bared her soul seeking support is wonderful. She has and deserves my utmost respect. How awful it must be to hold and love a child that you may have to return; its possibly worse than going through what I as a B-mom had to endure; I concieved a child and had to let go; she was invited in and selected to parent this child, her actions were very deliberet....my heart goes out to Blessed6 and her family as well as the childs Mother and her family. Please make no mistake, *Z* has every right to change her mind, but its heartbreaking to have Blessed in the position that she's being put in. Fair or not its difficult; for everyone and my heart goes out to everyone.  There does not have to be this degree of seperation within the triad. All of us should and can have one single purpose in mind and that being in the best interest of the baby. We simply don't have to choose sides and Blessed is the person who came here seeking advice and support.  I noticed that you, Kcmomma are a new poster; perhaps you can observe and learn before chiming in to critisize. This is a support board and you are being anything but supportive with your post. JMO....MissyM  \n",
      "Hi Brat...I somehow missed this thread until today and for that I apologize. I see you have recieved some excellent advice from some excellent folks so there is nothing I can really add. :o  I posted to say that my oldest daughter, Keri was born on Sept.1st and she had 2 tiny teeth the week before Christmas of the same year, so she was just shy of 4 months. I attempted to breastfeed in the hospital but I developed a UTI with fever which required antibiotics so I had to stop after day three. She did fine with accepting the bottle and showed no signs of \"rooting\" or missing the breast until she was about 10 weeks old ie: a month before her teeth actually appeared. At that time she started the behavior you described with your daughter and I'd never even had a sitter for her. The weird part is that while she did it with me frequently, (mostly at night when she was tired) she did it with my Mom and her Dad constantly. I'd heard newborns could smell/sense milk thus the rooting with me but I knew this wasn't the case with her Granny or her Dad. It was embarrassing to have Mom hold her in public and have Keri go bananas looking for her breast. :confused: I knew she was very very content with both Mom and Mike so I guess in her own way, she sought further comfort from them. It stopped when she was 11 and entering puberty!!...LOL; Nah, she stopped at about 9 months when she became more autonomous and moved on to bigger and better things.  I am going on and on and posted to say GO WITH YOUR GUT! Get the cam...if nothing else it will make you feel better and you deserve that. You are an awesome Mom but if you truly need an answer to the \"Am I nuts\" question, just visit the BTE and you'll know  \n",
      "Judilyn...I am so sorry you have this problem to contend with and even sorrier that I don't have a solution to offer. Iposted to say that you don't have to feel guilty about thinking she might need meds daily; LOTS of kids in her situation do. I worked on an Adol. Psych Unit for years and believe me the kids who are in-patient are given meds daily. The only time we'd with-hold meds would be during \"blind studies\" in which one RN would either give the medication or a placebo and the other shifts would observe and record the behavior in an attempt to see if the medication could be with-held successfully.  I say please talk it over with your Doctor and don't feel guilty about wanting your child to have a \"normal\" life daily. Best Wishes....MissyM  \n",
      "I wanted to chime in because my issue is a \"related\" off-topic thing. I am 47, my d/h is 51 and we are pregnant so you can only imagine the remarks we are getting. I expected the usual witty comments but the nosey questions simply amaze me!  BTW: My hubby in his excitement had a banner delivered and hung across the front of the house while I was at work that read \"We're Pregnant...Again\" the day we discovered this so everyone knows. :o One neighbor asked since our youngest is 24 if we'd switched birth-control recently and when I said no she asked if we use condoms...:eek:( obviously not.) Another lady asked,What if its a retard...will you keep it anyway? (yep...the hospital has a no return policy). A cousin asked if we were doing this to save our marriage or something :confused: ( we wouldn't be doing this or THAT if our marriage was in trouble...especially that! The kicker for me was when a respected church member stated she felt God would be OK with me having an abortion considering that its likely to be abnormal...:eek: \"we think God being the forgiving God that we feel Him to be would indeed forgive us if we asked Him to do, BUT being abnormal, should that be the case, does not make a child unlovable in our eyes. The horror stories are the worst; despite the fact that I am a Licensed Physicans Asst. and Mid-wife who knows slightly more than the average person about neonatal risks, I am flooded with the gory details of \"my friends Aunts hairdresser's daughter who had a late term baby and the baby was born...its never a first person account of the story and when I ask for a phone number to call the person the subject changes.;) It boggles my mind...MissyM  \n",
      "After work today I stopped to pick up my Rx's at Walmart and ran into a lady I've met a couple of times in the past but don't really know. She over-heard the pharmacists explain my medicines usage to me and asked if I were pregnant; I answered yes. She then rushed into this series of horror stories about malformed and/or retarded kids (her terms) born to older couples. She ended by saying \"Most of these kids are miscarried anyway and its probably for the best, you don't want to spend the rest of your life dealing with a kid who may never be potty-trained. I was mortified.  I regained my composure and answered that my husband and I were just happy to be pregnant and that we aren't expecting a \"perfect child\" just the child thats perfect for us and should he or she come with every malformation known to man we'll love it all the more because its ours and should it never draw breath outside of my body we will grieve it for the same reason and never ever would we feel \"its best\" that it didn't survive. I then said \"The biggest problem in having a successful pregnancy is stress and I find YOUR concern for OUR child very stressful; I need to get away from you now.  The next customer in line agreed that her comments were heartless and the pharmacy tech offered me a seat and a drink. The *talking head* turned beet red and stammered out \"Well I was only trying to make conversation...\" Maybe, just maybe she will refrain from saying this to someone else.  I don't usually \"speak out\" but I couldn't avoid it today...just wanted to share. MissyM:)  \n",
      "Originally posted by djp03  IMHO I suspect that those who espouse the \"trust but no need to verify\" theory have never had their hearts bludgeoned and their wallets thinned by a seemingly \"trustworthy\" bad apple birthparent. Texasmommy, feel free to pm me if you want the blow by blow details of what we went through. Having said that, obviously the majority of pbirthparents are good people as are aparents. However, I would be very wary of pbirthparents who won't release medical records requested by your agency.  When I decided to place my daughter one of the first things the agency requested was a signed release of medical records form. THEY had my entire pre-natal medical record BUT I have since learned they did not share this with the PA-parents. They spoke of me in broad basic general terms; She has no drug abuse or alcohol issues, no communicable diseases, no mental health problems...etc. My point is this information while vital is still private, and I for one pray that never changes...MissyM  \n",
      "Your first post started out by saying:  \"My husband and I were contacted last week about a private adoption. We gave the mother a deadline. \" Your later post read:  Is it really unresonable to ask the mother if we are a family in the running? If she chooses to parent, we would support that, becasue that is the kind of people we are. The two statements are so vastly different and that is why IMO you recieved the feedback that you got.  Even though you say you aren't prepared to accept this baby today and need the time to become so, its possible for you to do this with only a moments notice...trust me; I had nothing ready when at 29 weeks I gave birth to a premature BUT HEALTHY baby girl who weighed in at 4 lbs. 13 ounces and was released from the hospital when I was 4 days later, but I worked it out.( We were delibertly hesitant in baby shopping because we lost a child 2 years before her during the 7th month and we'd decided to wait until month 8 to shop this time.) My husband, Mom and M-I-L stripped the shelves of K-mart/ Walmart/ Targets etc. and bought whatever we needed and 2 weeks later I had a baby shower given by church members. Even if the bottles don't match its nothing compared to asking a mother to make a hasty decision involving something so vital.  I can imagine your stress level is off the chain at this point as is hers; can you imagine what you would have felt had she called and placed you on a deadline? Thats what the strong reactions were about.  Just one other thing; its off-topic but IMO needs to be addressed, especially since it came from you. I know P-aparents sometimes refer to the progress in a P-bmoms pregnancy as milestones, but IMO its inappropriate. I'm referring to this statement:  \"She lost her mucus plug on Tuesday night. From what I've heard, she will deliver within two weeks.\" Thats so very personal. If you were having a face-to-face conversation that others could overhear would you describe another womans pregnancy/body function this way?  I often read this type of reference in this forum and wonder how it would feel if a P-bmom posted :\" They are both infertile, his sperm count is the lowest ever recorded and her ovaries are totally useless...\" Its demeaning and insensitive to do that. And its not just your post; recently someone posted:  \" We're dialated 2 cm. today\" in reference to their matched P-bmom...they reduced her to a womb report. Its like thats how they saw her. I couldn't imagine that same postee coming here to report that \"Our 12 year old daughter is up to 4 maxi-pads a day now.\" Some issues have no place being openly discussed about someone else.  I don't mean to bash you but its something I've wanted to address for a long time.  Best wishes in whatever comes your way....I mean that.>>>MissyM  \n",
      ":eek: :) :o  Aw Shucks...thanks guys! You all are too kind; and I am doin' great! MissyM edited to add>>> about the pampering thing; be careful what you wish for! I am being over pampered if there is such a thing.:rolleyes: Every time I move, yawn or exhale during the night Mike jumps up and yells \"Whats wrong...are you OK?\" I haven't had a full nights sleep in 2 months. My kids are now on a mission to make me the largest woman alive. The girls ( especially Tovia) keep cooking my favorite foods and dropping them off, BUT all I have a desire for is shrimp lo-mein and carrot cake, so our 'fridge is running over with the healthy stuff. My son and former baby (age 24) calls every 6 minutes and there is only so much I can find to discuss with him. Maybe I should have just bought scrub tops and sweats and hid this little development for the next 5 months! Thanks again>>>MissyM  \n",
      "Originally posted by Ready4Baby  My best suggestion is to use a small syringe, place it as far back into the mouth as possible, don't try to put it all in at once. Once it goes in, if you blow in the babies face it forces them to gasp and swallow (hence the reason you only want a small amt in there) I don't have kids, but giving kids medicine in the ER, that's the most effective route I've found. Of course giving kids medicine is always pretty much a guessing game! :)  To avoid forcing the gag reflex place the dropper/syringe towards the side of the infants mouth between the jaw and side of the tongue and gently squeeze in a small amount of the medicine. MissyM  \n",
      "Hi Miss...welcome to the forum. I am not here to bash you and in fact I am a B-mom so my advice might not be what you want, but here goes.  IMO there are some serious boundary issues that need to be addressed before you make any changes; as stated, these should be handled by the agency.  Perhaps you could e-mail her and say Dear ~~~, (how are you...we are fine ...baby is great etc.etc. )THEN : if you will recall back on May 29th we each agreed that we would have the following amount of contact; pictures every 3 months, letters every 6 months, etc. At this time in the best interest of everyone involved we should begin the process of abiding by the agreed upon terms. Beginning Aug.1st I will mail the pictures to you and will do so again on Sept.1, 2004. Should you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter now or in the future, please contact the agency at 123-456-7890.   Sincerly, ~~~~ Babs...while I am sure you mean well, I am not sure the B-mother would have a positive response to:  \"Tell them you understand that they are in pain, and that you hope they can move on knowing that the birthchild is loved and happy, and that while they will not have free rein to call and visit, you will see that they get updates as promised. \" Its simply too condescending to write that \"you understand she is in pain.\" You ( A-moms) have the baby, so in her mind you can not feel her pain just as she can't feel your joy. The last thing you want to tell someone in her posistion is that you \"hope she can move on knowing the baby is loved and happy.\" She is grieving; its a process....it takes time; HER time. The knowing is sadly not enough. She is dealing with a loss; she can not yet focus on the positives.  When my own Dear Mother died from cancer I knew she was no longer in pain and as a Christian I feel she is with God, but knowing that in no way lessened the pain of not having her with me. In time we as birthmoms do get past the moment and get back to the business of living, but it can not be forced.  I don't mean to bash you, I think your heart is in the right place, but we can't simply say \"I hope you can move on;\" she is dealing with a loss that equals a death, and she can't just move on, nor can we suggest that she should. BTW: anger is a part of the grieving process; it should be accepted, but the inappropriate behavior should not. JMO as a birthmom....MissyM  \n",
      "Originally posted by snyder52601  This is one reason why we went to an interantional adoption. Since the child is your's since it was finalized, you could go to the court and ask for a restraining order, due to the fact they are not going by the rules. I am sure your baby can pick up the vibes of the issues, even thought it may not be expressed. If you do mail anything to your agency, put their address as the return and send to address, that way if they just hand them the envelope, they won't have your address. I would also see if anyone in the agency has given out your info, then they should get fired for not following the rules. If all else fells, go back to the judge and tell him the situation and tell him you now want this to be a closed adoption and want all information sealed.  Snyder: Thankfully Miss Kristen has reached a decision regarding what she'll be doing and hopefully it will work. I posted to say I think you read much more into her post than I did because no where has it been mentioned that the baby has picked up \"the vibes\" or felt anything negative from the issue at hand. I am sure this A-mom is protecting her baby completely. Also, until and unless there is an implied threat of sorts there is no reason for a restraining order nor did she indicate she felt the need for one.  At this point she isn't suggesting she needs a way to close an agreed upon semi-open adoption; IMO nothing short of placing this family in danger should close an open adoption since its done in the best interest of the child.  It makes me question the true motives of A-parents who go into adoption agreeing to openess but once the ink dries are so quick to see closure as a remedy to what ever is happening within the B-family. They are grieving for Goodness sake! They need help dealing with the pain of not having this child with them. They deserve understanding too. B-moms are not monsters; we are mothers in a unique situation trying to function.  If having a child who never gets to meet his /her bio-family is the reason you were moved to adopt Internationally, then great for you. But it doesn't mean your son/daughter will never want to meet them and maybe then you'll get the chance to fully understand what your reasons for an IA adoption mean to him/her and he can tell you how your decision has affected her.  Your post just doesn't sit right with me for various reasons....Sorry! ...MissyM  \n",
      "At the posters request and my own personal desire to see it happen I have moved this post in order to start a new thread and deal with the topic of hurt feelings in posts when terms that aren't considered pc are used...MissyM HappyMomAnna You are echoing what I have felt many times in these forums. I am an old-timer here...that really just lurks reading and educating myself for the most part. I'd love to see us debate this topic some more...but I am unsure how to start a thread...and bring the topic from one place to another.

Whether this thread has been hijacked or not: know that there are many of waiting parents out here that do understand these feelings and where they come from--EVEN if we don't agree totally. I know from experience that it is extremely hard to get opinions or suggestions from my normal support base because they haven't been through adoption--or at least adoption today. Keep coming here...because we need to have this base to support one another.   \n",
      "I also, personally found it offensive that a 16 year old, who is/was clearly not in a position to parent a child herself, was interviewing and judging people on their ability to parent. I am very glad that my parents did not have to go through this degrading process. I had wonderful parents but I doubt that they would have participated in this type of situation.  dl....I can understand why that thought would might occur to you if she were indeed \"judging and interveiwing people on their ability to parent\" but IMO thats not was the process was designed to do. Thats the job of the Social Services dept of the agency; pb-moms are presented with profiles of couples who have met the requirements and completed the home study necessary to adopt; she was interveiwing couples in an attempt to find a \"perfect fit\" for her and her son and IMO she is the only person who can...One couple decided to withdraw based on the amount of openess and visitation she desired after being interveiwed by her, had she not been involved in this process at that point the results could have been disasterous. The very thing I loved about the show is that the involved parties talked...really talked and layed their cards on the table and left nothing to chance. I didn't get the \"lets just wait and see how it turns out\" feeling that IMO is so easily misinterpeted.  I will say that the show was tasteful but at times misleading. The couple who adopted Matthew, the 2 year old, didn't just walk in to talk to a Social Worker and leave as parents. If Matthews Mom was able to walk in an agency and drop of her 2 year old, look at their profile, select them as they sat inside and have him adopted that day, something is terribly wrong :( but thats the impression the show left us with. It mentioned no counciling, no options, no legal preceedings for them, nothing except \"She's living in a womans shelter and she can't parent him....\" The Social Worker says \"Well this mom didn't select you BUT we happen to have another mother who has....do ya' want him he's here now,\" and BAM! they are parents. I didn't think this scene was accurate, but thats just IMO....MissyM  \n",
      "if any of my childrens teachers said to me..\"your son is obnixous and crass and we need to remove him from the class\"....you bet i wouldnt take that sitting down... its quite different then saying \"your son is having some behavoral issues, is there anything we can do to help or what you do at home....\"  True...it does sound better especially when coming from a teacher and spoken to a parent; HOWEVER...I didn't make the assumption or get the impression that bbear said that to anyone. He posted it here in an open forum where adults are posting, replying and reading. If the words \"crass and obnoxious\" are bothering you I personally will refrain from using them here, but unless and until you can point to the page and/or post where bbear says he stated that either to the kid or his parent, I say no harm done.  As far as the spanking thing goes; its a personal matter that needs to be decided between parents. A household that agrees to avoid physical punishment and use only words and seperation can be just as \"abusive\" as one that spanks if used incorrectly. In todays Dallas Morning News there is a Metro page story about a 7 year old found locked outside in a trailer and removed by CPS. When contacted the father says he does that when his sons ages 7 & 9 misbehave; he says he would never \"hit\" them because thats abusive and he locks them in the trailer to punish them instead....so far the father has not been arrested because there was no obvious sign of abuse; his idea of punishment is no greater than locking a child in his room according to some CPS workers; others (my daughter being one of them disagree's so an investigation must decide.) The best judge of whether spanking should be used is the parent raising that particular child.  I don't want to be a part of an attack bbear campaigne...if thats what this is then I'm out of this thread; if it isn't then why are we spending so much time and energy tearing his posts apart word for word? Why is he having to explain them? I bet there are a zillion posts in this forum where kids' behaviors are called things much worse than \"crass and obnoxious\". He labeled a childs behavior that as he described it does seem to be very obnoxious. I know boys will be boys and all that junk but IMO when the principal is calling to report that your child is misbehaving not once but twice the time has come to take action. Missy M  \n",
      "H/M Anna...I agree with you...your situation is, of course, the exception and I admire you for keeping that promise! My point is that no one can sit at a computer and tell me how I can best raise or discipline my kids. How we handle misbehavior was a matter to be discussed between Mike and I and while we can respect that there are other ways to discipline, we as a couple decided what was best and with trial and error we discovered what worked and what didn't. BTW: early on we decided NOT to spank; the usual method of punishment was time out; then removal of some \"thing\"..ie: tv, radio, favorite toy etc. Later on it was room restriction and loss of allowance, still later it was what ever it seemed to take!  My son climbed out of his window and stayed out all night at 15; I was a basket case. I thought he'd been kidnapped until my brother located a him in a local parking lot. He was high as a kite and later admitted to smoking pot while out; We woke him up the next evening and we \"forced\" him to go to a local homeless shelter and do chores; our reasoning was that since he didn't feel appreciative of being in the safety and comfort of our drug-free home he should experience life outside it. We also wanted to expose him to the \"down side\" of drug abuse. With our input he was partnered with an outreach recovering addict and was assigned restroom cleaning detail for 6 hours; AND he did not stay out again.;) The worker explained how he ended up there and how difficult the life there was and the clean-up helped impact his words. We also offered him drug treatment but he stated it was his first time and he did not enjoy being high. At 19 we confessed he was smoking heroin and we put him in treatment. Tough Love. He has 4 years, 6 months and I think 22 days clean and still attends N/A meetings.  My son is an addict...he says so. Its not a pretty word and its not a claim to fame. My point is if someone came here and posted \" Drug addicts ruin society and are lowlife losers\" I wouldn't agree with the statement but I couldn't get offended by it simply because some are. Just as some kids are obnoxious and crass... Everyone of us can have a different veiw of the same picture. If a heroin addict has burglerized your home and stole your car, you might indeed share that statement. If you know my son you'd be shocked to discover you were describing him, too. He is clean, sober and a contributing member of society. He donates regularly to that same shelter and mentors teen addicts in recovery. He is a doting single father of a 2 year old daughter and he used his savings account interest and his begging talent to form a \"midnight-madness\" basketball club that keeps young men off the street from midnight to 6am....in a local gym. They shoot hoops, eat a free meal, watch free movies, do the 12 step program, use the computer, sleep on mats, play chess, dominoes and checkers and basically vent...in an attempt to stay away from crime during the hours most are committed. Its called \"Just Say Yes\" (as in to the question Am I My Brothers Keeper? ). He purseuded the Dallas Mavericks and Stars to donate their used sneakers and basketballs to these guys. During the day he is a Money-Market Account Manager at Chase.....2 to 3 nights a week he's at the gym mentoring....my son is an addict....MissyM  \n",

Because we know from \"J's\" family that she verbally abuses her son. I also know that it is healthiest physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually for a child to be raised in a loving 2 parent stable family.   I captured your post to disagree. The baby that \"J\" gave birth to was hers and it was her right to parent her child. You say you cried for a week...thats mild compared to what she would have gone through had she placed her baby feeling that she shouldn't. If you read some of the posts from adoptees in this and other forums you will realize that its best if the bond between Mother and Child are left intact from birth. Adoption will never replace that as the better option. There are many kids both adopted and bio that come from great single family homes; to suggest otherwise in this day and age is foolish. What would you say to women who have lost their husbands to war, accidents, and disease? Would you suggest that you are better able to parent their young kids simply because your spouse is alive?  \n",
      "I am not adopted but when I was born I was only 3 pounds I was not \"pretty\" and I have red hair. I sure am glad my bio mom didnt \"back out.\" I will say what every one else has said if you are looking for the perfect child then you need to reconsider raising a child. Just because a child starts off \"perfect\" doesn't mean that everything in their life will go smoothly. Accidents do happen. What if your child is in a car accident and paralized or burned very badly. Would you want to \"back out\" at that point because they are not \"perfect\" anymore. Just my 2 cents. Julie  \n",
      "I am a Physicians Asst. and owner of a Birthing Center in Dallas. I do routine ultrasounds monthly as a *cover your azz* situation. My insurance payments are too high not to. Ultrasounds are merely a tool to discover if everything is developing normally; it is the only way to actually \"see\" whats going on inside the womb. Its the best ( and safest)way to chart growth. IMO the fact that she is having ultrasounds done routinely is nothing be concerned about; any more than routine blood pressure checks.   \"I am not sure of the rules yet because I am new at this but is it out of line to call the doctor and make sure everything is okay?\" It is both illegal and unethical for a doctor to discuss a patient without that patients permission. To even confirm that she IS his patient could be a violation of patient confidentiality. Even if the patient were your daughter it would not be *OK*every patient over the age of consent has this right and in the case of pregnancy age of consent is deferred to the situation; meaning a 14 year old is treated as an adult simply because she is pregnant....MissyM  \n",
      "Originally posted by KatieMill  You are echoing what I have felt many times in these forums. I am an old-timer here...that really just lurks reading and educating myself for the most part. I'd love to see us debate this topic some more...but I am unsure how to start a thread...and bring the topic from one place to another. If you'd like, please move this to a new thread...and I'm sure most of us will follow. Yasta: As a waiting adoptive mother, I understand and applaud your reasons for posting. Whether this thread has been hijacked or not: know that there are many of waiting parents out here that do understand these feelings and where they come from--EVEN if we don't agree totally. I know from experience that it is extremely hard to get opinions or suggestions from my normal support base because they haven't been through adoption--or at least adoption today. Keep coming here...because we need to have this base to support one another.  Katie...I moved your post over to a new thread titled \"Coming 2gether in the Triad\"....MissyM  \n",

I would never stand around while some guy, related or not paws my kids after they move away...its not OK to make them uncomfortable!:mad: Its not OK to invade anyones personal space!  Having said that is it possible for you to talk with her privately and share your issues? Even if she won't continue visits without him you will have put the ball in her court and she will be the one making the choice not to visit.

      "Originally posted by seeking2adopt  Everyone needs a place where they can be real and not expected to be perfect. This forum has often been that place to me. I know that many people are reeling from this recent tragedy and words are being said that perhaps would not be under different circumstances. As an adoptive mom who is still \"learning the ropes\" as far as what is politically correct to say or not say, I simply want to plead for some understanding and patience for others who may be in the same situation. Some instances that come to mind are those who have expressed anger recently at aparents in these forums who talk about \"our baby\" or the fact that \"we are dilated 2 cm\" or call a pbmom a \"birthmother\" before she places the baby for adoption. I believe that many aparents, like myself when I first entered these forums, simply do not know that there is a right or wrong way to say these things. Having learned that, I try to be much more sensitive in these areas and I am sure that others are willing to learn, too. But again, we need a place to be real and not perfect. Can we show some understanding and sympathy for one another regardless of where we fall in this adoption triad, and try to lovingly correct one another rather than railing against one another? Just some thoughts from my heart.  Dear Seeking2...I appreciate your heartfelt comments and while I would agree that this forum should be a place of solitude and comfort I want to say that all sides need the same respect and understanding.  Adoption is a very emotional issue; it is one of a few instances that both joy and grief can occur within the same moment. As a B-Mom and one who objected to the words you mentioned, I purposely did not address my comments to either the poster(s) or to the thread in which they were posted. I took them to a place where my thoughts and concerns could be heard on the subject and I could voice my displeasure at seeing them. I did not want to bash any of the A-parents in these threads but I needed feedback on how other B-moms felt at seeing them. I also have the need to feel I can be real. I needed validation for my feelings of dismay.  IMO its a serious disregard of ones privacy to post ANOTHER WOMAN'S cervical measurements on line in a public forum. It reduces the role of the expectant mother to a \"Womb for Rent\" instead of the person she is. The \"we're being induced\" is belittling. \"We\"( they) were not...she was. I bet no one here would dare post their teenage daughters menstrual cycle here; ie: \"we're cramping\"...or \"We're up to 6 maxi-pads today\"...its degrading, its private, its HER business.  Listen, as a B-mom I wanted ...no...needed the A-parents to be excited about the baby. I wanted them to bond with her in every way. I just didn't want or need the bonding to violate my privacy, or dehumanize me. We are not something to be discussed without doing the actual discussing. There is a post that describes the procedure used to thin the wall of the uterus to expeed contractions....thats beyond excitement. We are here and we are reading. I will agree to be patient to newcomers who don't know the terminology if you will be mindful of the fact that being discussed like this is degrading.  I thank you for your post; I speak only of my personal feelings on the matter, others may differ and I respect that. I just want all of us here to feel that its safe to speak up...myself included; something this tragic weekend has taught me is that we matter too....MissyM from my heart to yours :)  \n",
      "Please just like I know all adoptions aren't perfect, please realize they all aren't bad either. I get tired of being portrayed as the babystealing adopter.  You will never ever read a post where those words or any variation of them are used with my name attached. I have never veiwed A-parents in a negative light. Without her A-parents I don't know where my (our) daughter would be.  I also understand the relationship between you and your friend...its a friendship. Its the open forum posts about \"our b-mom\" that leaves our eyebrows raised...even if you printed \"Margo\" is dialated 67cm...it would sound less dehumanizing...JMO>>>MissyM  ps>>>>this is a great thread to educate and enlightened...can we just do that and not get angry, please?  \n",
      " \"However on a forum like this I think that people may let their hair down, and guard a little.\"  Respectfully 3girls1boy, I captured this part of your post because the orginal poster started this thread saying, \"Can we have a place where all members of the triad can be real and not perfect?\"  As members of the triad I as a birthmother feel the terms are offensive. I understand the part about wanting to share the joy, I understand wanting to let your hair down and shout it from the rooftops....about the baby, not about the woman who is carrying the baby as if she is a means of transport only. Its OK if you do this in a room with family and friends... its OK if you and the expectant mother get together and discuss her in this manner, its not OK if other triad members in an open forum are offended IMO.  I personally would never ever post using the terms you posted as offensive; even in a moment of extreme anger or passion would I do that. Even if I felt that way about A-parents ( which I do not) would I ever disregard the fact that there are A-parents here who find such terms objectional.  Even in a forum such as this especially in a forum such as this where B-moms and even P-B-moms are here seeking support and comfort for some very painful issues one has to remember that \"letting your hair down\" may not be appropriate to some. I just went back and read some of the posts regarding the births of the babies due last week and I can't help but wonder if we're being ultra sensative. I don't think any of those posters meant any disrespect by announcing what was going on in relation to the labor process. I saw it as excitement and joy not as cold, hard women waiting for the brood mare to drop. As far as the \"we\" and \"us\" goes, again, I don't think it is out of context here. Again...I captured this quote to refer to it. I have no issue with joy and excitement in these \"announcements\". Perhaps its not out of context here; however we are here discussing if members of the triad are offended by certain posts and why. There are B-moms in this forum who are offended...period.  If the shoe were on the other foot and I or any other B-mom who found herself in a messy or say suddenly closed formerly opened adoption came here and posted the \"baby stealers\" and \"adapters\" crap that the anti-adoption sites promote you'd probably understand that it does not matter what the context is when its being used; it is offensive to other triad members....MissyM  \n",
      "There are several threads going on regarding the show today and I wished they were combined. I posted to say I think Dr. Phil only used the term \"Adopted Parents\" to clarify and keep it all straight in everyones head. I know its what I do when I'm posting here; I state \"I am Tovia's B-mom\" but I wouldn't dream of starting a face to face conversation with anyone this way. I simply refer to the woman who adopted and raised her as \"Gina\" and when I'm speaking to Tovia I ask, \"so did your Mom get her car fixed, etc.?\" I never say the A and or B word; Gina is her mom in every sense of the word...  I wish every triad member had the ability to see the parents of the twins. They were so supportive of the kids wanting to search and keep in contact. That IMO was beautiful and it made me cry.

      "Hi...let me start by saying while I am not an A-parent (I'm a reunited B-mom) I am AA and my husband is CC. You asked if race matters and I'd like to say God led me to a man who's family sees color as something to be embraced...but you on the other hand are a part of a family where it does seem to matter; therefore my question to you is \"Does extended family matter?\" Unless you a fully and firmly prepared to disengage from your M-I-L totally and completely please don't adopt a child(ren) of another race. Its not fair to your child, you or even your M-I-L as she has already stated she will not be able to do what Grandmothers do to, for and with a child of another race. Something of this magnitude has the potiential to damage a child and break up a marriage. You stated: \" I dont feel like I should have to change my views of having a multi racial family because of a few ignorant family members. But I find myself stessed and scared about the issue in an already stressed and scary situation.\"   Just as you aren't willing to change your veiws on what it is you want and desire in a family unit chances are they won't be either. As long as you know what lies ahead you can weigh the risks, problems, stressors etc. and decide....just remember the only person you can change is you...don't go into this situation expecting anything different than what you see now.  34 said....  \"And a bonus would be that your family will meet this inncocent life and welcome him/her into their hearts and home. Just remember, most people are predjudiced because they just do not know what it is like to interract with someone who is different. And once they do, their life and view point changes.\"  I am sorry but I disagree. I think that prejudice exists because of ignorance. \"The unknown\" may create fear, but seldom does it create hatred....You'd have a hard time locating an adult in this day and time who hasn't interacted on some level with a person of a different race. Whether its the grocery store, the bus, the mall, the TV, Starbucks, the dentist's office, the school, its hard not to \"know\" a minority if thats your goal. We're everywhere and at times I question why \"WE\" are labeled \"The Minority.\" The reason their veiws remain unchanged isn't due to a lack of exposure its a lack of common sense and a lack of desire to change. THEY are not uncomfortable with these veiws, SHE is. I wouldn't lay the burden of changing lifelong attitudes and issues at the feet of my newborn; chances are that if Martin Luther King couldn't do it a baby won't either. IMO if this postee isn't able to accept their racists veiws she certainly can't expect to change them by bringing in the very thing they hate...JMO; MissyM  \n",
      "Hi Becky...I posted to say I agree with Aneni; I think you should arrainge for the visit in a safe neutral place and let it happen. Everyone should have closure in such an important matter.  As far as him having an arrest record, the same can be said for Martha Stewart, Sharon Stone and Zza-Zza Gabor. My point being that having a criminal past doesn't prevent someone from being a good B-parent. You mentioned a time frame that would lead me to believe his jail term was short; did you discover why he was jailed? Was it for a dangerous crime, passing a hot check or an abundance of jay-walking tickets? Most of the heavy crimes aren't simply \"jailed\" or released after 2 months.  I am a b-parent and I am coming from a different angle I know, but you posted:  \" I think the quandry for me is that we choose open adoption (this is our second adoption) with birthmothers who respected and understood our desire to gather information for our sons for their future. But in this case I don't feel as though the BD's desire to visit is motivated by his interest in our son - and I guess this may be the 'nut' of the matter - that the more we learn about him the more we feel that we have to shield from our son.\"  IMO if you choose an open adoption without the stipulation of \"if you are arrested\" then its up to you to keep your end of the bargin, period. Please consider that all you have to act on is pure speculation. So far this b-dad has done nothing to endanger anyone....so far he has lived up to his end of the agreement. Whatever his motivation for asking to see his son happens to be is between him and his God; none of us can see inside his heart; if you deny him what you initially promised him then it will be you who is wrong and it will be them who will wonder what your motivation is or was when you agreed to \"open\".  The biggest fear for b-parents is having closure occur for whatever reason the A-parents decide is good enough. IMO until something negative happens there is simply no reason to deny what you agreed to. Please consider what they will feel if you do this....MissyM edited to add ps>>>:I hated writing that the birthfather possibly could have a gun, but why take the chance??   I didn't see any mention of a gun in your post; I wonder why this even comes up here??? Look, IMO if the b-parents were perfect they would have probably elected to parent; it seems that they have looked beyond their feelings and done whats best for the child. Uncaring criminals would not be coming to your home to escape the law, commit other crimes or anything else, it makes no sense. What if the guy simply needs to say goodbye to his son? What if he's getting himself together and is a better person than the guy they arrested? If you're gonna go with the \"what-if\" scenerio's then you should consider them all. MM  \n",

      "Originally posted by love4  I agree with you Jackie. My daughter's birthmom wanted her very much. It saddens me to think about that. I believe she justifies my daughter living with her. I know she struggles with many emotions. She feels very guilty. She told my daughter that she lost her once and she is not about to lose her again. I really like this women. It feels like she abandoned me also. I wanted us all to get along. But like you said, I have to let go just as you are doing with your daughter right now. Sorry you are struggling with the relationship with your daughter. I think we all go through those times. Letting go is the biggest lesson I have learned over the years. Take care. love4  I am wiping away the tears as I post; I remember your beginning in this forum and your story. My heart goes out to you; you will make it simply because you already have.  You posted: My daughter's birthmom wanted her very much. It saddens me to think about that. I believe she justifies my daughter living with her.  I wanted to share that when my daughter and I reunited I had to fight the urge to do that. I listened to the many complaints she had regarding her A-mom and I almost fell into the \"but now that we are reunited life is grand\" trap. It took a real effort to remember that while her A-mom wasn't perfect I hadn't expected her to be. She was everything I wanted her Mom to be and more; she was an excellent mother as evidenced by the fact that she raised a wonderful albiet manipulative daughter. I allowed my daughter the chance to vent but thankfully I resisted the urge to comment or compete. Something I believed from day one was that I couldn't have raised this little girl, and something else I believed from day one was that her A-mom could. No matter how much I want to hold her and never let go, I realized from the moment of her birth that I can never do that. She is my child but she has a Mother and I will always respect that. I gave her legs but Gina, (her A-mom) taught her to walk; I gave her eyes but Gina taught her what to watch out for. Her love of music undoubtedly comes from her b-dad who plays many instruments, but Gina drove her to piano lessons; I gave her a brain but Gina gave her food for thought on a daily basis, and payed for college. Your role in her life can never be denied; not even by her. She now respects me for respecting her Mother.  Please don't feel like a \"foster mom\" you were and are so much more. I pray that someday soon she'll come back to a place where all of you can be comfortable; but even if that never happens, IMO its not about you....Bless You>>>MissyM  \n",
      "I did not feel personally attacked by your previous comments nor did I indicate I wouldn't read a thread in which you were posting; I said I wouldn't post advice to you as you seem to know it all. These boards meet my particular needs for triad information and I not allow someone with so little invested to push me away. I am now going back on my word as a concerned B-mom: You posted this quoted message above: While I think there are very informed posters, and I have gained some really good information from the board. Sometimes it makes me wonder 1. do I really want to adopt. Sometimes the board makes it seem as if it would do more harm than good. 2. Do I want a truely open adoption. I realize that the Birth mom has a HUGE emotional investment (totally an understatement) But I want to be the parent, not the Co-parent. This board sometimes give the imperssion that is what \"open adoption\" is all about. I know it isn't but sometimes when I am feeling insecure it makes me wonder.   IMO if you are using this forum to decide whether you should do something as critical and as serious as adoption, please don't. If you are using this board as a way to decide if adoption would do more harm than good, please don't. Who exactly are you fearing that it will either benefit or harm, anyway? You go on to speak of what you want and what you feel and if you've learned nothing else from this forum it should be that adoption is about the wants and needs of the child; period. BTW: In this quoted post and thread YOU did exactly what you lashed out at others for doing in the other thread; you posted a topic about well...posting and you moved on to your desire to adopt and how this board impacts your decision.

Once again there is a debate about who is Mom, how many Moms there are, who gets to call who what when where and why and IMO its all senseless. Everyone says \" do whats best for the baby\" but then turns it around to say, \"but she is grieving, she gave you a gift, you should feel grateful. blah, blah, blah...\"  You are now parenting this child. You have decided to call her Carly.You want  everyone else to call her Carly. Everyone else  except her B-mom is complying with your wishes. That is wrong of her. Despite what her feelings, issues, desires, and stage of grieving is she needs to call the baby Carly. She needs to put the needs of this child first and if nothing else call her Carly simply because it is what she hears on a daily basis so it's less confusing for her.  Look, you are very kind to seek a solution to this issue when you had it at your fingertips all along. Do what you posted 3 pages ago....limit her contact to the original agreement and nothing more.  If I were this b-mom I'd be worried about Carly thinking I was some flake who couldn't get her name right on the few occassions we do share together.

My suggestion to you would be to put your concerns in writing; put what you are willing to tolerate in writing also and take these to mediation with you. I would have social services reinterate that these are the rules. No other phone calls, visits, car seated outings, summer vacations or anything else would be up for debate.  I am a reunited b-mom; I am also a grandmother of 7. If its as you, say he is her only grandchild BUT he was living in cars and eating cereal bars, I'd have to ask why she didn't feel the need for visits and car seats then?

      "Originally posted by always learning  I've been checking out this forum for a few months now and finally registered. I learned quite a bit from everyone, and hope I can return the favors. My husband & I just completed our home study and waiting on a **. We are using an adoption facilitator. It's taken me a lot of courage to say, or should I say write, this out loud. This waiting period is very difficult. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to loose my mind. I don't want to sound like a winer. I know there are MANY of you waiting, or MANY of you that waited for a very long time. I guess I just want to know if anyone out there feels, or felt, the same way. Every morning I wonder if today is going to be the day that we get our phone call or email. And, every day that we don't, I'm disappointed. Our facilitator says it could be 6 - 9 months, it could be less or could be longer. I have a difficult time staying focused on anything. I have a difficult time controlling my emotions. Like I said, I feel like I'm loosing my mind. Reading adoption stories or literature really isn't too helpful; it almost makes it worse. I apologize for my venting. But, I figured this was the best place to do it. Thank you for listening.  Welcome to the forum...its always good to see newcomers! I bet as a new poster you're curious about the astriks (**) in place of the initials you actually typed. Since your screen name here is always learning I hope you won't be upset if I share this with you.  If you go back and read your post not as you meant it BUT as its typed, you'll probably laugh....sounds as if you and d/h are sitting on the potty holding the daily paper waiting on something to be \"eliminated and flushed.\" As a birthmom we openly object to being referred to in this fashion, and the moderator has a filter in place to automatically remove it. I KNOW you didn't mean it in a vicious manner but I bet you'll see why we find it objectional.  I understand the wait is long and difficult but once it ends and you bring that baby home you'll someday laugh about it just as women in labor do! Take this time to pamper yourself and read and post here. Take it from one who knows...its a wonderful place to vent and gain support, knowledge and feedback. Best Wishes...MissyM  \n",
      "Originally posted by bromanchik  Unfortunately Sharon, I have seen it. It is not a birthparent overtly saying, \"I do not want you to bond with my baby.\" It is more wanting to hang on to remnants of the parental role that belong to the adoptive parents. I have had people say to me, \"How can she/he do ____ (fill in the blank here.)? That's my baby.\"I would also like to add that there are still many birthmothers and birthfathers who really do not have any true choices. The teen-ager that will be thrown out of the house if she does not place. The single mother of two who is barely making it. Many birthfathers who are told the only good thing they can do is sign away their rights, the homeless, the mothers who will have CPS involved if they do not place. I could go on, but I think you get my point. It is not always the case that women and men place their children because of an \"inability to parent\". Financial reasons and lack of support are more of an issue in placement decisions than not being able to parent.  Brenda...I read your post and I'm not sure I agree with it. I am certainly guilty of saying / feeling / thinking this way about Tovia since she was raised 2 doors away from me. How could I NOT? I think its like Sharon posted: \"Giving birth to a child conveys a powerful sense of entitlement. Signing a piece of paper does not remove that sense of entitlement. Nothing does. Nothing can. When you have created a child, nourished that child in your own womb, and given birth to that child, when you look at that child's face and see your own features staring back at you, chances are you are going to have no problem believing that you are that child's mother. \" But even feeling this way didn't mean I didn't want her a-parents to not \"bond\" with her. I just couldn't deny or forget the \"bond\" I had with her, it didn't go away.  Gina had no sense of style; not for herself and not for Tovia. This didn't effect her ability to parent or my desire for her to parent my child, I just inwardly groaned each Sunday when I saw Tovia at church. Tovia had this mound of long thick Angela Davis 6 inch bushy nappy-azz- carpet-like - afro-styled hair that the OB nurse should have permed in the delivery room just after the cord was cut!  The fact that Gina hadn't done it by age 10 certainly made me question the validity of her eyesight; not of her ability to bond. I simply wanted to flat iron it right there in church. Having said that and knowing she wasn't the only child with ugly hair I did feel a sense of entitlement, BUT I never acted on it. I just don't see how we as b-parents can avoid these feelings, nor should we have to....MissyM  \n",
      "Originally posted by redhedded  Xanny, I agree wholeheartedly with your observations. I think the bond is an individual one. Sharon, while I respect completely your feelings, bond, and sense of responsibility, I do not think that every mother has it - whether parenting or not. I think each of us is so different in our sensitivities and expressions, and many mothers that I know and spend time with, have had to work to create that bond - with the children that they carried in their womb.  But...at some point that BOND was created and not diminished by placing them or having placed them for adoption. I, like Sharon, developed that bond with Tovia in utero, from the day I first threw up and realized that I might be pregnant again...had I not had some type of bond I could have easily abandoned her in the hospitals restroom. If anything the very moment I made the decision to place her that bond intensified. Its a lot like it was when my Mother became a Hospice patient; I knew our time together was limited and I zeroed in on every moment we had left together. I HAD to b/c it was the only time we had. I had no sense of a future with Tovia. Her adoption was expected to be closed.  Years ago one of the main reason agency's insisted on \"closed\" and attempted to prevent us from seeing, holding and breastfeeding our babies during the hospital stay was to prevent us from bonding, and developing this feeling of entitlement. What they failed to realize is that the bonding experience doesn't begin at birth and doesn't end at adoption. They failed to realize or admit that we can (and do) have these feelings and still place our babies in another womans arms. Even when the papers are signed we still have the bond.  I agree that not every b-mom has this bond. Not every um...\"Natural\" (for lack of a better term, not to disrespect) mother has it instantly either; but the ones who do IMHO have every right to them; and those that don't are very lucky and probably sleep better at night.  I hope we won't get into an \"a-mom b-mom\" conversation here. I just need to be heard saying that adoption does not diminish the feelings, thoughts, prayers and desires for our kids; if anything it increases it b/c its all thats left....MissyM  \n",
      "Originally posted by redhedded  to her feelings or the bond she developed with her child. On the contrary, I indicated that bonding is a very individual action. For some it is instantaneous and occurs before birth; for others it does not. For some it takes time, energy and performance of daily care and nuturing; for others it does not. It is not an indication of your ability to parent or the kind of person that you are. I think, for some, it is more indicative of your personality and has nothing to do with adoption. I certainly do not succumb to the idea that ALL women bond with their children, whether they raise them or not.  Oh...OK...I replied with your post but I didn't mean to imply that YOU per se thought those things...sorry if I left someone else with that impression...lunch is on me; frying up a load of fish and fries with a side of cole slaw, and chocolate covered cheesecake to make amends...MissyM :o  \n",
      "I agree with \"Brats\" post; it only really matters that the person you're speaking of or to isn't offended by this term. BTW: As a b-mom I am not personally offended by it b/c I have never been called that ( the adoption was closed) by anyone; but out of the b-moms here who are offended by that term I simply never post or use it here.  I also think different terms touch us in different ways. A fellow b-mom who I greatly admire addresses herself as her daughters \"first-mom\" a term that I simply dislike. {can't explain why BUT it rubs me the wrong way.} Since I know she would never say that in a derogatory manner I don't object when she refers to me as such...{ I cringe!}  Basically its all very personal....MissyM  \n",
      "Originally posted by LCSC  My husband saw our 3 week old baby's birthmom today to give her some pictures we had promised her before the birth. She was so excited to see my husband and made a point to call her boyfriend (baby's birth father) to come and see my husband too. They look up to my husband like the father they never had and excitedly told him all about what they had been up to and that they were great and getting to go out to parties again. Not once did they ask about the baby. Am I crazy to be happy about that? Somehow I am comforted in knowing that to them, the baby is an afterthought now. And I had been agonizing the thought that they were suffering and in much pain. I feel awful for admitting this, but I am glad that they are back to their irresponsible and self-centered (they're young- both 21) selves.. I feel more secure and it seemed cemented that this baby is ours and no one elses. I am not the babysitter, I'm the mommy and my baby isn't going anywhere. My question: Has this happened to any of you and what was the outcome or relationship you developed with birthparents who either separate the themselves from the situation or just don't seem to care (either a facade, or they really don't care) about the baby they gave up?  thanks  Let me qualify my answer by saying I am not an a-parent; I am b-mom to my daughter placed 32 years ago in a closed with benefits adoption.  I posted to say please don't feel you can judge a b-moms feelings by her actions. For years I had this public \"face\" that I pasted on when I needed to just to get by. Placing a baby is a loss and each of us expresses grief in our own time and way; its very personal and no one has a right or reason to expect to see it, or judge what they do see; besides at 3 weeks the process might not have even began. It may not occur, especially ifthey know or feel its going to remain open to them.  You also sounded judgemental when you say \"they are back to their irresponsible self centered ways\"....they are both young; only 21.... IMO if they were as you describe, they wouldn't have placed their baby with you to begin with. Age 21 isn't too young to parent. Adoption is a very unselfish act, basically centered around at least 3 other people; and they showed a lot of responsibilty for doing it. Obviously you met them before the birth b/c you say they are \"back to their...\" if their lifestyle wasn't a problem then, why is it a problem for you now? Surely there was a good responsible Med school student out there somewhere who would have spent the rest of her life weeping and mourning in your presence just so you'd know she cared.  I am not flaming you but I wonder what emotions you were hoping to see in them? Maybe chasing after your husbands car begging to keep the baby over night? If they are indeed back to their old selves, they have every right to be, if they believe in your ability to parent they should be. Life goes on and despite the pain of having to place, we deserve to find happiness after doing so. IMO you should be happy for them.  If you hope to maintain an open relationship with your sons b-parents (which will greatly enhance his life in the long run) maybe you could become just a little bit more tolerant of them and a lot less judgemental. My Mom always said \"If it ain't broke don't fix it\" and I don't see your situation as a bad one....MissyM  \n",
      "Originally posted by LCSC  I understand what you are trying to say. And to clarify, I absolutely believe that placing a child is the most unselfish act a birthparent can make. I can't even conceive the pain it must feel to place the child you gave birth to- to someone else. I have gone thru childbirth, so I know of what I speak. My post was simply to ask for insight on what I was feeling. And I guess it was my mistake to be honest about how I was feeling. NO I do not expect to see a crying mess, barely to go on, scouring the city for the child she could not keep.....But I did not expect to see our birthmom acting so nonchalantly, asking no questions about the baby, and onto the same path she had travelled before. YES her lifestyle bothered me before. The drug use I learned about in her agency history that they sent to us only AFTER the adoption papers were signed. She picked us- we didn't pick her. Our situation isn't textbook- we met the birthparents thru friends of friends who knew she was adopting out her baby- we met them and they essentially picked us and developed a close relationship with them and their agency only 8 weeks before our daughter was born. We were the inexperienced ones here, having a natural child of our own, we were not familiar with adoption in depth at all. This couple had placed three other babies, all born less than a year apart, for adoption. No I'm not here to judge and excuse me if it sounded that way to you, this post wasn't really about her, it was about my reaction, MY feelings about her actions.I realize these are early days and things, and people and emotions change everyday. I simply wanted advice.  LCSC:  You have a right to feel and express any feeling you have; just as the b-parents do. You say here you were seeking insight into your feelings but thats not how your post read; in it you asked this question: \"My question: Has this happened to any of you and what was the outcome or relationship you developed with birthparents who either separate the themselves from the situation or just don't seem to care (either a facade, or they really don't care) about the baby they gave up?\" That question pasted above is what I responded to. I will now attempt to answer it without being so judgemental, OK?  Please don't allow your feelings or their actions to influence your agreement to raise your child in an open adoption. If b-parents were able / willing to change and become what they needed to be in 3 weeks they probably wouldn't place at all; I know I wouldn't have. Remember that everyone has the ability to change at some point, but it takes time. One of the saddest things about placing a child is that there are no handbooks. Noone tells us how to act to seem appropriate, we just try and go on the best way we know how and for some that may mean partying 'til you drop.  I personally decided to not reveal myself to my child although she was placed with a neighbor and lived the first 14 years of her life 2 doors away from my family home. It wasn't that I didn't care or didn't want to, I simply couldn't handle that. Once I placed her I felt I no longer had the right to connect with her on that level. I cried buckets of tears BUT the a-parents never saw this. My emotions, fears and feelings were not open for them to veiw. If I honestly felt they were the best parents for her then there was no reason to show them how much placing her destroyed me.  Your most recent post indicates they are showing some sense of responsibilty by having jobs, by having sought pre-natal care, by calling you when they were bored lonely, etc. (thats not the usual route for some active drug users.)  My point is their lifestyle should not be a point of contention for you and shouldn't influence the degree of openess you agreed on having. Your emotions can directly impact the way your baby feels and reacts to them. It appears that you are looking at their lifestyle as assurance that the baby is there to stay, and yours to keep. In time you will become more secure in that role and you in all likelyhood won't have the need, time or desire to look so closely at them. On the other hand, you answered your own question in your post; you said:   ***\"I realize these are early days and things, and people and emotions change everyday.\"*** Just hold on to that thought. Three weeks is a very short time to change lifestyles, and if they decide they want to be professional party animals they simply have every right to do so; and no matter what they will still hold the title of b-parents to your daughter.  I apologize for coming across so harshly but it irks me when a-parents attempt to judge b-moms actions, emotions and behaviors. Our lives shouldn't be held up for public scrunity, just as yours shouldn't be. Relax and enjoy your blessings.....MissyM  \n",
      "Originally posted by LCSC  Thanks for responding. I agree they have had to get more responsible, and with our financial support ending in three weeks, getting jobs was a must for them to pay their rent and living expenses. I also agree with almost everything you've said. I do try very hard not to judge. It's not us who are considering the amount of openness based on their lifestyles, it's them, as it should always be the bparents we take our cues from. They simply want 4 photos a year the first year and nothing more after that. This was the same agreement they have with the other two aparents they adopted out to. I tend to role reverse and put myself in her shoes to try to decipher a situation or an action or reaction and I need to stop and just see where time takes us all.  ahhhh...(((((((LCSC))))))) Hugs to you and best wishes on your latest addition. Of course you have fears and anxiety now but in time that will lesson; I am praying for you. Give the 4 photo's and since they want nothing more start keeping a log that you can share with your daughter later on if they desire. MissyM  \n",
      "Originally posted by melon161  LCSC, I wouldn't worry about your feelings. They are just feelings of insecurity and they'll go away once you realize that nobody's going to take your baby away. Don't worry, feel however you want to feel, nobody should tell you how to feel. Stacy  I alo feel she has a right to her feelings as I posted earlier, BUT she posted to ask us our thoughts on her feelings so in accordance I gave her my opinion. MissyM  \n",
      "LCSC...looking back over this entire thread it seems the only person who came across in a manner that you may have found offensive or harsh was me. Please accept my heartfelt apology for having done so; as that wasn't my desire or intent. I am really hoping that you will reconsider you decision to leave the boards b/c even if you don't feel you'll gain anything from the people here, with the way you've expressed yourself I have no doubt that there are many here who will undoubtedly benefit from your input.  The matter of adoption is a very sensitive and emotional one for me. Nothing in my life prepared me for this journey. Because of the pain I've under gone I'm sometimes very vocal, passionate and opinionated and at times hostile; those are my feelings as a b-mom and perhaps I need to examine the way I present them. In the privacy of my den or bedroom its easy to become over zealous, and as hard as I try and temper that I don't always succeed. I posted to you several times in the hope that I could avoid what has occured now. I didn't agree with your initial post BUT in no way did I find you disagreeable. I honestly felt we had established a dialogue, and that whatever differences we expressed were resolved, but apparently I was wrong.  Again I ask that you reconsider as you are in a posistion to bless and support so many; myself included. Please don't make a hasty retreat, think about staying and know that you'll not be offended by me again. MissyM  \n",
      "Originally posted by Xanny  I just want to clarify my statement earlier: 1) I had read in a book that AA and biracial adoption can be less expensive, and I know someone who adopted an AA boy years ago who told me there was basically a racist \"fee schedule\" that infuriated them--AA boys were the \"cheapest,\" followed by AA girls, biracial boys, biracial girls, Caucasian boys, and Caucasian girls were the \"most expensive.\" This outraged my friends and cemented their decision to adopt an AA boy and raise him with all the love and support they had to give. However, this was several years ago, and it sounds like things have changed. I will stop giving out this misinformation. ****Even if it were still applical today IMO it shouldn't have been posted as it is very offensive to me, a Black woman married to a White man and mom to 3 bi-racial kids and b-mom to one Black daughter. Wonder what would happen if I walked in to an agency and specifically stated \"My husband and I are here to adopt a big 'ole 8 pound white boy because we have tons of cash and we want the most expensive model money can buy; none of those cheap brands for us!***** 2) My reprimand of Bromanchik was about the accusational nature of her message, not the message itself. In fact, I included several cautions about the risks of surrogacy in my own message. I have my own beliefs about right and wrong, and my own reasons for adopting. However, I don't think it is right to impose those beliefs on others. I choose instead to point out the risks involved, suggest any alternatives I see, and allow the person involved in the situation to make her own choice. ***So did Brenda; BTW: in her latest post Ginger THANKED her for doing so.****** My point was not that I think surrogacy is right, but rather that I have seen several people slammed on these boards for voicing unpopular opinions or asking about controversial subjects. I don't think that's what this board is for. If we drive away the people who don't agree with us, how will we change their minds or help them through whatever difficult situation brings them here in the first place? It's one thing to say, \"I don't think that's a good idea: here's why.\" It's another thing to say, \"You're amoral to even consider that.\"  ***** Ummm...musta' missed that post.*** Ginger is just another woman who wants to be a mom. There are tons of us on this site who have been in the same situation: trying to make a family in a way that will work for us. If you have a reason that you think her plan won't work, let her know about it. Ultimately, though, it's Ginger's decision, and she came her asking for advice. Let's help her make the right decision for HER family. *****Brenda DID let her know. And just because someone wants to become a Mom and has every right to do so does not equal by any means necessary. Brenda and lots of others have insight into the implications of why it may OR may not be the \"right decision\" especially for the pb-parents and child-2-be.  I also had a relative offer to adopt my daughter; she was an aunt, age 32, married, Bank V.P.. Christian, etc. 1 bio-child born before she developed a life-threatening kidney disorder that prevented her from concieving again. As much as I loved and trusted her I had to painfully decline her heart wrentching offer. I KNOW she is a good Mom; I just knew in my heart I couldn't sit by and watch her parent my child without interferring, and neither of us deserved that. BTW: she later adopted twin boys after fostering them for 2 years.....MissyM --Xanny  To the last poster: AA stands for African American ( in this thread) ...and Acoholic's Annonymus....and my cousin Anita Anderson>>>>Missy M  \n",
      "Originally posted by LouiseT  I have yet to meet a person who had a child, either naturally, through ivf, or adoption, that could honestly say that they did not do so in order to enhance their lives in some way. In my opinion, all children are originally conceived with the some of the parents needs in mind. How can a person act on behalf of a not yet created child? Ask 10 moms why they had children. I bet a lot will say because \"they\" wanted a family.  I know a lot of b-moms who would beg to differ BUT I agree with most of what you posted.

      "Originally posted by Skye Hardwick  Hello, I thought I'd post this poll I thought up on two boards here at the forum -- I think it will be interesting to read everyone's!! It kind of only fits bMoms and aMoms - but adoptees are welcome to jump in on it! ------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- 1.) How are you connected to adoption? ***I am b-mom to my second born daughter, Tovia Vonetye*** 2.) Do you do anything special to celebrate national adoption month (Nov.)? ***Yes, I go over to the agency I used and we do a ballon release as part of a wonderful ceramony and I also volunteer at the festivals in which older kids in the system are introduced to p-aparents.*** 3.) When growing up, did you know anyone connected to adoption? ***I have a cousin who was adopted. There were also several church members with adopted kids.*** 4.) If you can remember, when did you first learn about adoption as a child? ***It was to the best of my knowledge about age 8 or 9 when my Moms sister and her husband adopted my cousin Cheryl.*** 5.) In high school, did you know anyone who had a baby and placed? ***No, I never even heard the subject discussed; to do so would have caused that mother to be judged harshly.*** 4.) Anyone in your family, other than you, connected to adoption? ***See #3.... 5.) When adopting or placing your child, did anyone say rude/ignorant comments? What were they? If you are an adoptee, have you received rude comments? ***My adoption was hidden from my extended family and friends.*** 6.) If you had to do things all over again with either placing your child or adopting, what things - small or large - would you do differently? *** I'd have never kept silent when I discovered she lived 2 doors away from me. I would have told her a-parents who I was and how I felt about her being there.*** 7.) How has placing/adopting your child changed you? ***OMGod....are you kidding??? It changed every aspect of my life; I stopped sleeping around and became the kind of person who could have raised her. I became someoneshe could be proud to call Mommy. I went to college, got 2 masters degrees, got a great career started, married and had other kids, all with the foolish impossible fantasy-idea that she would be \"awarded\" back to me for a job well done someday!*** 8.) How has your views changed on adoption since placing or adopting your child? *** I've learned so much about adoption that I don't automatically feel it's the right thing to do. I certainly felt the desperation that comes with facing that choice, but I didn't know how much inner strength I actually had, or what options were available to me. I am so in favor of open adoption or at least providing and making sure the adult child will have the info they need when the time comes.*** 9.) Do you have a closed, semi-open, or fully open adoption? ***Closed that became \"closed with benefits\" with her being placed 2 doors away from me. 10.) If you have an open adoption, what has been the toughest thing about it? ***N/A ....but in my situation it was not being able to reveal myself for so long. Just seeing her without having her was very hard.*** 11.) If you have an open adoption, what has been the best thing about it? ***N/A*** 12.) What has been the greatest lesson you've learned about the other side of the triad? (example: If you're an aMom, what have you learned about bMoms) ***That her a-parents weren't honest with her.They were so threatened by the thought of her having b-parents that they never told her she was adopted. I have so much love and respect for them because I feel they did this because of their fear of loosing her. I also think that a and b parents are more alike than different. *** 13.) Name your biggest pet peeve in the adoption world? ****The secrecy, the lies, the fact that my daughter had to get a court order to learn the basic facts of her own life. I hate that agency's charge so much for their services and although they are staffed by professionals they seem to lack insight into the basic needs of triad members. IMHO they would be better staffed if they simply used triad members. I detest the fact that there are no laws in place world-wide to protect open adoptions from becoming closed.*** 14.) If you are a birthmom, would you ever consider adopting a child? Why or why not? *** There is no reason why I wouldn't BUT I never did.*** 15.) Are you satisfied with the adoption agency you placed/adopted through? Why or why not? ***NO! They placed my daughter 2 doors away from me after extensive home studies....THEY KNEW but didn't give a flick about my feelings or any thoughts about hers. It was simply a money thing. UGH!!! Don't get me started.*** 16.) Do you currently attend a support group or receive any counselling through an agency? ***I am in both a support group besides this forum and I have a therapist.*** 17.) Name a disappointment you've felt after placing/adopting: See # 15 18.) Name a misconception people (family,strangers) have about you being an adoptive mom or birthmom or adoptee: ***That b-moms can / should/ will just \"get over it\" that having Tovia so close wasn't like we were \"really apart,\" that I didn't have the same pains griefs and issues that other b-moms in closed adoption have, that feeling that you've made the right decision means it shouldn't hurt. People don't understand that my feelings for Tovia are identical to the ones I have for my raised kids. Its never mattered WHERE she lived, just as it didn't alter my love when Keri and Kia went off to college, it only mattered that she was my child.*** 19.) What books, magazines, websites, articles, links, etc ...have you found most helpful after placing/adopting? ***This site and your site have been most helpful, as have your poetry and stories.*** 20.) Write anything you wish here:  Hi Skye....great questions....I miss you all over there.>>>>Marcia M  \n",

      "Originally posted by Sharon  It's nice to see that adoption professionals are working sooo hard to find families for children who need them. :rolleyes: Since they have so much free time to lurk around these forums, spying on members and interfering in their personal lives, it's obvious they're earning every cent of the outlandish fees they change. My advice to any lurking adoption professional: get a life, and focus on the job you're supposed to be doing, ie. finding appropriate placements for children who need them. This is a public forum, but it is a forum for the SUPPORT of people TOUCHED BY ADOPTION, not for people getting rich off it. If you are not here to give and receive advice and support, you really have no business here; get lost. :mad: Melissa, I hope you don't stop posting here. Why be intimidated by this nonsense? Keep posting as often as you need to, and invite the birthmother to join too. You've done nothing wrong, and you've got nothing to hide or be ashamed of. Best wishes, ~ Sharon  Sharon....very well put. I don't want to distract from Melissa's post but while in therapy with Tovia the therapists pointed out that the thing that I had to contend with (Tovia being placed practically in my lap) was something I needed to confront the agency about; so we did. They have no answer... no reason why such a \"huge mistake\" happened. Please tell me how no one there noticed we had the same street listed, same church and how MY PARENTS gave her a-parents personal references and no one noticed??? Its crap, they knew but were driven by $$$. It was \"get the money at all costs\". I don't trust agency's. I may be opening up Pandora's box but if Rosie O'Donnell can adopt kids 4 weeks after going to her attorney and everyday people wait years....its a money driven business.

      "Originally posted by sjwilson98  this went from helpfull to an attack on me. I'm the only one she has told about the pregnancy, so what am I suppose to tell her? Ignore her altogether. I had to tell her something, was telling her to go to the crisis center wrong? Would you rather she is on her own? Would you rather she abort it all alone? Sharon, it is cousin, not niece. So if you want to claim on oversight, start there. I agree I was being selfish, nearsighted, and putting the horse before the cart. But I'm sorry I can't have children and that this is all very new to me. Missy you gave your baby up, how old were you? Were you going be a junior in HS? Did you have a disfuntional family? And you still gave up your baby. If I'm not clear about something drop me a line or respond, but you don't have to *yell* your opinion from the mountain tops. Missy your first point about the store senario caught my attention and made and impact, you were right. But no need to kick me when I'm confused.  ****************************************************Hi sj....sorry you felt my passion about this matter and trust me thats all it is.....I don't yell when I'm at my computer, I simply touch the keys, but to imagine a relative in here discussing whether or not she should pursue adopting her cousins baby before its been placed makes me want to go straight to the mountain top..... My bio is here somewhere, just click on my name and scroll down until you find it under posts by Missy. To answer your question, I didn't give my baby up at all.....I placed my daughter for adoption when I was 16. She was my 2nd child and I kept the first. Actually I became pregnant during my sophmore year and gave birth during the summer just after being promoted to my jr. year, so yes I was. As far as having a disfuntional family, no, I didn't but I was certainly a disfuntional person, falling in and out of lust at the sound of a car horn. Even though it was my 2nd baby in as many years and there were and are members of our family wanting to adopt and who have since successfully done so, none of them acted like lawyers chasing an ambulance. None of them were in a tissy wondering if they she should try to adopt my baby before I decided to place her. Many of my aunts offered me a warm shoulder, a place to stay and just became a friendly face with an open ear, and if they were upset that I didn't reward them with my child, its been 31 years and none of them have mentioned it.....  Dot: now you add that \"she was placing it for adoption....I can understand, thats the issue here, you gotta wait until the mother-to-be does that.  sjwilson: you said \"I'm sorry I can't have children\" thats a seperate issue,Dear one that you might always have even if you do adopt. Sorry you felt attacked, it bothers me when people waiting to adopt look at pregnant girls/women as if they are shopping at Krogers, lets take her baby, wonder if we should call up the cousin with twins blah blah blah. Everyone carrying a child has the right to make plans for her child.....in her own way, at her own pace......Missy  \n",
      "Love4..... I am so sorry for your loss as well; its OK for you to miss and grieve and vent as much as you feel you need to; I am happy that you have found this wonderful system of support to help you do so. I am a reunited b-mom and I am shocked by your story. My 31 y.o. daughter has never given me any indication that she wants to move in with me and recapture the *missing pieces* of her life. She lives almost exactly 2 miles from both me and her a-mom; each of us lives within a 4.5 mile radius and trust me, thats close enough!  I don't understand your daughters behavior, or why a grown woman, ANY woman, adopted or otherwise seems so needy and dependent. I know my daughters a-mom is very aprehensive at times during our visits and until I read this thread I have wondered why. She is semi- OK with her visiting me and her siblings in any of our homes, but did not fare well when we traveled out of state.(We visited Disney and her uncles in Cali.) Maybe it was in response to the distance, maybe she felt we'd have *too much fun.* Maybe it was because we were meeting still other *new family* for her. Again, it puzzles me. She is also upset that we are planning a trip to Aspen in Dec.  The thing is, she need not worry. I could not then nor can I now raise my daughter....she has done a splendid job of raising her. It was so well done. It needs nothing from me to complete it. No matter what my daughter and I discuss, where we go or what we do, I can not replace her a-mom and I have never felt a need to try. Her impact and imprint on my daughter is firmly ingrained, not only within her, but in me as well. Physically, my daughter looks enough like me to be called mini-me; but she oozes A-mom....this is her child, too. The relationship between us is constantly evolving....great today and less than great other days. I am sputtering around trying to say, the novelty will wear off. The emotional roller coaster ride is a long winding one. It has hills and valleys, highs and lows and the ride is not yet over. Maybe she happens to be up on the cliff right now, maybe she needed to find not her b-mom, but her self. Whatever the case is, she was / is wrong to *abandon* you, to cause you pain, or to see you in pain and not try and rectify that pain; IMO. Just remember that the only person you can change is you. I would never tell you not to grieve, or how to grieve, but don't let this break your spirit. It doesn't sound like its about you, or even about her b-family, its about her. You did what parents do: we give them all we have to give and then they do with it what they wish. It could be any of us.

      "OK All : Picture this>>>> I am a 5' 2 female, the color of *Oprah* with braids and my wonderful hubby is a 6'4 blue eyed blonde! Talk about strange looks/ comments/questions!!!!! We have enough stories to write a novel, esp. after 30 years together. The \"best\" of the worst was from an elementry school teacher who was substituting after the reg. teacher left to give birth. We went in to get my then 6 year old from his class one day and she nearly screamed when he called out Mom. She goes \"you're Dereks parents.... I didn't even know he was mixed, and I stated \"oh all the kids in this class have parents who are different, all the moms are women and the dads are men, strange isn't it??? She went on to say \"but seriously, don't MOST interacial marriages have the women being white and the men being black?\" At that my husband turned to me with his eyes as big as plates and yelled \"YOU'RE BLACK???\" I just thought you had an awesome tan, a great butt and a bad hair day! You're really black?? Tell me its not true, he cried before SHE bolted from the room.:confused:  \n",
      "Bless you for being so concerned about the needs of a p-Bmom; thats wonderful. You posted:  I have been going to lunch with her for about a month now trying to get to know her but I can't tell if she's (1) uninterested in contact after the baby is born (2) scared to ask for what she wants (3) doesn't know what she wants OR (4) all of the above.   As a B-mom I'd guess that (4) is probably the correct answer. I was so unsure of what I was doing and expected to do that many times I did nothing. ( My childs adoption was closed, but there were other concerns the SW addressed that I couldn't respond to.) Its a very emotional time and its stressful. IMO if I were you since you are able to see things clearer maybe you could offer specfic suggestions and get a response. ie: \" I'd like for you to have pictures every 6 months, is that acceptable?\" Or maybe you could give her options; ie: \"Would you like to see the baby three OR four times a year?\" Maybe you could say you'll be sending her a letter or e-mail soon and you'll be asking for her opinion....that way she can think over her answers and feelings or even share them with someone she trusts who can help her answer your questions. Is there a legal rep or therapist involved with her? Has she spoken to anyone else who has been in her shoes? Can you contact them and explain your dilema? I hope it works out soon....MissyM  \n",
      "These are JMO too.. I recently proof-read and typed a Dear Birthmother letter for church members as a favor; its their 2nd adoption attempt also. There was only one thing that I as a reunited B-mom would have liked to have seen changed : They did great with showing pictures of them as a couple and of them with their 4 year old son. They included the name of their sons birthmother in the description of what they hope to have in the new relationship, ie: \" Our sons birthmother Lori and I have a great relationship. She has spent several holidays with us and we value Lori as a family member.\" They IMO should not have named her...MissyM  \n",
      "Hi All.... I am the first person who responded when this thread was started back in Dec.2002. I am the b-mom who blurted out *I would never have considered a single mom when I placed my daughter.* To be honest, 31 years ago I truly wouldn't have considered it, and back in Dec of last year, I guess I still didn't;I thought that it took a husband and wife to raise a child, and that by selecting anything less would be giving a baby less, but I can see how foolish that sounds.  One of the Dr.'s at the hospital next door to my clinic recently adopted a newborn single-handedly and its wonderful! She is everything a b-mom could ever hope to find. Her daughter is her life! She is 41 years old and has no prospects (or desire) to marry but knew she wanted to parent, and by Gods Amazing Grace is doing so. She waited until her career was up and running, (she's an OB-GYN) and she is just so loving with her child. She and her now 7 month old daughter are so fortunate to have each other.  I am posting to say that I was so closed minded for so long and I am just happily reporting that the blinders are off and I thank God that there are women (and men) like the ones in this forum who have adopted and continue to adopt while single.

      "[QUOTE]Originally posted by dpen6 Saramurphy, Just a couple of points I want to make... I understand you wanting to support shattered dreams. I do to. It is usually ok for the child to stay with bmom IF they truly believe they can do it. It usually is best for baby and mom. *** Yes ... But, as an adoptee I DO NOT consider it barbaric for my bmom to realize that she could not parent me and MADE ME AVAILABLE (after 2 years in foster care) for adoption. I take offense to anyone calling them adopters, they are my mom and Dad. There are many bmoms that should not parent or can not parent at the time of birth...in the childs best interest it is also very courageous and mature for the birtmom to realize that. *** I don't know the specifics of your foster care and your mother. It's possible that she worked very hard to try to make it possible to keep you for two years. Many, many infant adoptions are a permanent solution to a temporary problem, and \"temporary\" can almost always be read \"financial\". As I said, I do not know her specifics, but the two-year timeline is intriguing. *** Please do not misread my use of the term \"adopter\". It is the legal term and I use it to keep all the characters straight. While they may be your mom and dad, they aren't mine! LOL. It's simply the legal term to identify their role. *** The pregnant woman may not be making decisions out of courage and maturity, but out of despair and lack of options. There may be other ways to address that than losing one's child forever.

      "Dlouis you posted: \"While the fact that I was adopted and did have biological parents was NEVER denied, it was not something that was focused on as if it made me different from any other child ~ or family. There was nothing different or out of the ordinary about my family and I personally felt/feel very comfortable about that. My perception of having an open adoption is that it would have made me feel not a complete part of either family. As I didn't live the life of an adoptive child in an open adoption with adoptive parents and bioparents, perhaps I am not comprehending that it could be done in a way that the child does not feel like half and half instead of whole. I only know that I am very glad I grew up the way I did and if I were to adopt a child, I personally would want my child to have the same security and sense of belonging that I did.\" __________________ : I am posting to say that this is exactly why I never told Tovia or her A-parents who I was. I placed my daughter in a *closed* adoption because its all the world offered, and the fact that the agency IMO violated their trusts along with the terms of our agreement didn't mean I'd have to. I wanted my child to have as normal a life as she could have; that was the reason for her placement, so despite what MY feelings, needs and urges were, despite the fact that its gutwrenching for b-parents who don't know, despite the fact that I could have *opened* it with a nod and a hug at any point, I abided by the closed agreement that I signed her over in. I didn't want her to be half mine half theirs in any way.  I have been severely bashed in pm's and in this forum by b-moms who complained that I simply \"didn't care\" enough to reach out to her in her early years; thats so far from the truth that I don't usually respond. I didn't want her raised as an \"ADOPTED CHILD\" I just wanted her to be a child with a happy well-adjusted childhood...without me since from day one, I knew I couldn't do it.  I will admit that I am not against \"semi- open adoption\" in which information such as medical history, pictures and contact info is available when the child is of age. I am not even disputing the claim of A-parents who say their visits and phone calls work for them and their child(ren). I will just boldly state that had I been presented with this option I am doubtful I would have used it. Of course my situation was closed with benefits; I \"knew\" my child was alive and well daily. For the parents who are left wondering after agreeing to a fully adoption, I hurt for you, I can understand your pain, but its not something I would have opted for. I wanted to put aside my \"need to know\" and allow my daughter to become their daughter totally.  Having said that while I disagree with the concept of withholding the fact that my child was adopted from her, I UNDERSTAND what their intent was, and that was to not have her feel different. JMO....MissyM  \n",
      " \"But as I said, as a mother I cannot imagine giving my child up unless there was NO WAY I could keep them. I don't see how I could have enough to give 4 children, and not another. My children are my world, and the only reason I bring children into this world is because I want them to be mine.\"  As a b-mom who placed her 2nd child after keeping the first; I am  thankful YOU don't see how you can do this. It goes back to walking a mile in my shoes...In your second quoted paragraph you say, \"the only reason I bring children....\" Well you are obviously are speaking from a planned pregnancy point of veiw. Not all of us were prepared to deal with the consequences of having become pregnant and I for one wasn't going to make my infant pay for my mistake. Unconditional love means agreeing to do whats best for you even if it kills me in the process. I didn't have a selfish need to \"hold on\" just because I gave birth. IMO your judgement of this mother in question is unfair; you don't know her situation. No one just wakes up one morning and says \"Ummm...lets see what I'll do today; get a manicure, see the new J-Lo movie, buy miniblinds for the den and give the baby away.\" Adoption isn't neglectful or abusive. Its an attempt to give your child the things they're entitled to that you can not provide; it doesn't matter if they are baby #1 or # 14. Attempting to fit another child in could possibly cause you to be unable to care for ANY of them; I wouldn't decide to keep a child simply because I've kept others....JMO here>>>MissyM  \n",

      "Originally posted by neebob  after skimming thru alot of posts, it seems there is one set of words for birthparents, one for adoptive. relinquish (sounds self-sacrificing, high road stuff) - birthparents disruption (sounds harsh! ) - adoptive parents. A latin expert could have fun with the root words I bet! Please let's stick to helping each other out, giving solid advise where we can, and not judging something we haven't been through. Remember that if someone is coming here and laying their heart out, it shouldn't be trampled on. (We have our kids for that! [joke, JOKE!!!]) . Lucyjoy, your kids ARE blessed to have you that will work so extraordinarily hard for them. The fact the you come here and help other people too, well. Take care eveyone!  I didn't see in this thread where anyone WAS judging anyone else; all I see is people questioning the idea of an adoption being disrupted and the effect it will have on the family, opinions I suppose the poster hoped to gather when she asked the original question; no one has even questioned the a-moms motives for wanting to do it and I don't see any trampling either.  You also brought up the different terms involved and I want to share MHO on the subject.  The difference in relinquishment and disruption is so very obvious; in fact if they weren't two totally different scenerio's there'd have been no need for the original post.  Relinquishment isn't done in response to anything the CHILD has said, done, felt or caused. It is never based on a child's behavior or the impact said behavior will have on the other family members. It is done{usually} to better the enviorment in which a child will grow, develop and live. When b-parents \"relinquish\" a child for adoption they are in effect placing that child in a better posistion for THAT CHILD'S SAFETY AND WELL-BEING...they are not having the child leave what may have been its only stable home for the past 8 years FOR THE SAKE OF ANYONE ELSE'S SAFETY AND WELL-BEING. I am not making a judgement call, I am only stating a glaring difference in what the terms indicate. IMHO there is no \"high road\" to take in placing just as there is no \"low road.\" Now that is a \"judgment call.\" BTW: as a b-mom I HATE the term \"relinquishment.\"  If I were to make any type of \"judgement call\" it would be in response to the line posted that says someone else agreed to foster these kids IF they could get the monthly payment from the state for doing so; now thats dedication....makes you wonder what conversation has taken place. If a bio-parent posted that we could get Mr. Louie across town to raise \"Problematic Renee\" for the price of a monthly stipend we'd be looking to hire a good defense attorney real soon.  I have no advice to offer this mother, but I hope you make the right choice for all of you.  \n",

I was searching the internet for hopefully an answer to our dilema. I happenned across this thread of conversation. I have to say to all the people who are against disruption, and who are making that poor family who started the conversation feel GUILTY....shame on all of you!!UNTIL YOU WALK IN OUR SHOES YOU SHOULD NOT JUDGE US!!! Missy: Re-read the posts before yours, where exactly do sense blame and an attempt to make this \"poor family\" feel guilty'? The only blame I see is here in yOUR post. There have been no attempts to judge add...only attemts at giving input and feedback.  I and my family are in the exact same boat. Except we were CONNED into adopting 3 sibs because they wouldn't separate them. NOW, after 3 years of trying.....we are pulling our hair out, our birth children are suffering from it and I'm here to tell you....OH YES THERE IS A DIFFERENCE between adopted and biological birth children!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Missy: You were \"conned\" into having to adopt 3 kids because they would not seperate a sibling group, you say? Wow, you only wanted what...the small one, the cute one what? Even so, why didn't you just walk away so that someone who wanted all of them could have a chance to raise and learn to love all of them? Can you kindly point out the differences in adopted and biological kids AS YOU SEE THEM????????????? I was just told about the guardianship thing also and we are considering it ourselves. I wish the family with the girls would email me privately. Maybe we can help each other out of this HELL.  You may indeed be involved in the most trying situation of your life; the fight may be harder than I could ever imagine; but to ask some one to help you out of this HELL is IMO just awful.

      "Originally posted by Sabra   Please let us know what you think of this comment? Adoptive families are different, not deficient, just different. When these differences are acknowledged and accepted, embraced, recognized, adopted children deal more successfully with the psychological effects of those differences.   I agree more with the posted comments than with the above statement if thats at all possible....maybe if the above began with \"Adoptive families were formed differently;\" I'd better accept it; however the way it reads now makes it just seem to imply a degree of abnormality; very very \"of out of the norm\" when the word \"different\" is involved. It needs elaboration, as it is now it sounds negative and I have an issue with that. Let me try and explain.....What would happen here if you substituted the words \"Black families\" or \"Mexican families\" for Adoptive families? My question would then become different from what? Its as if there is a family to be measured by...what are the standards that would mark an a-family as different? No matter how you phrase it when the word different is involved it still implies less than, not as good as, and since all families are different its why single out adoptive families?  I totally disagree with the blamket statement in the second sentence. Of course its possible to say that SOME or MOST adopted children deal more successfully .....but certainly not all. My daughter wasn't told she was adopted until she was 25, so there were no apparent \"psychological effects\" to deal with successfully as she didn't know she was \"different\" or in a \"different family.\"  On the other hand I know adoptee's in our support group who claim to have been adversely affected by all the attention placed on the fact that they were adopted. It was the FOCUS on it that they hated. They state that if it wasn't a \"big deal\" why make it a matter to be embraced? Its kinda like the celebraties mentioned in this thread who are being referred to as adopted kids 70 years later.  All in all its a very thought provoking question and I am taking it to my support group next week.....Missy M  dlouis Rocks....so wise!  \n",
      "Originally posted by HappyMomAnna  Adoptive families are different and our children need to be prepared for the remarks, opinions and ignorance they may encounter during thier lives.... By recognizing, embracing and accepting the facts that our families are formed differently our children will deal better with these differences. My adoptive daughter loves to tease her older sister, my birthdaughter by saying, \"I am specialer because mommy got to pick me.\" Everyone in an adoptive family needs to work together to make a whole family and each person needs to feel good about how they became part of the family.   Anna...I as the mother with 3 bi-racial kids AND a reunited b-daughter certainly understand a *different* family structure. My D/H and I are of different races, my placed daughter is of \"my \" race as she is his step child born before we were married; she also happens to be my second daughter , the oldest is his also born before we married and was kept ( a whole 'nother story) so I can relate to *difference*. I understand your post simply because you used the term \"are FORMED differently\" thats the extent of our family being different. Besides its formation our family is no different than the other families on the block......we have the same issues, joys, celebrations, math problems, favorite foods , laundry, and eletric bills that everyone else does.

      "Originally posted by lewellen  I think adopted families are preceived as different by those who have not been touched by adoption. I'm an adoptee and no one thought anything was strange about my family, me-the adoptee and two younger bio-kids, until they knew I was adopted. It was never a big deal within the family, but others made a big deal out of it.  Even in this day of blended families, when many children are raised by only one bio-parent, to get over the perception that adoptive families are second best. Even though those of us on the inside know better.  We need to talk more about this to others, not just among our selves. Right now some kid is cringing because someone has just made a remark about the fact they are adopted. The offending person meant no harm, they just needed to be educated. Wrong perceptions about adoption, I beleive are somewhat like racism or sexism, they come from ignorance.  I think we need to deal with this as we would a racist or sexist comment. To stay silent is to perpetuate the wrong. Speak up tell them you disagree, politely, then explain the reality to them. You might not change minds, but your adopted child will thank you, and you have set the right example. Lewellen  WOW....you said it all and beautifully! Thanks for your post.....MissyM  \n",

I know I am off track, but recently a co-worker, (a RN) allowed her husband back into her home after he was \"treated\" and given probation for sodomizing her 11 y.o. daughter. How does she think her child's gonna feel? How should she react while watching her mommy show love for this creature? The child has no choice.

      "Wow...interesting thread and wonderful responding posts. I hate to intrude on this very delicate matter, but as I read it I couldn't help but wonder why you allowed this to occur? If you indeed put someone else's name on your childs birth certificate then you have done her a grave injustice; AND you've committed a fraud by lying on an official document. Babies aren't meant to be handed out as door prizes to the person who stands by the mom during her pregnancy. The line that says \"father\" should list her true father on it; it doesn't say \"guy who supports you\" or the \"guy you're considering marrying someday.\" Just b/c the parents don't get along doesn't mean a fathers rights should be terminated, and niether does having someone else in your life who you feel would make a better father. You have actually put a whole new spin on identity theft and if you read any of the posts where adoptees are struggling with who they are, you will know that your actions were not appropriate and may cause your child to suffer emotionally someday; it appears there were valid reasons for his confusion as to who her father is.

AND HELLO- SINCE THE BIRTH FATHER WAS NOT GOING TO BE THERE AND HAD NO DESIRE TO BE THERE, I AM NOT GOING TO MAKE A PIECE OF PAPER TELLL HIM TO BE THERE. I AM SORRY THAT YOU THINK I PUT MY CHILD AT RISK. THAT WAS NEVER MY INTENTION. AND HOW DARE YOU DEFEND HER FATHER. I WAS LIVING WITH HIM WHEN I GOT PREGNANT. I TOLD HIM I WAS PREGNANT AND HE KICKED ME OUT ONTO THE STREET. I HAD NO TRANSPORTATION,NO FAMILY, NO FRIENDS. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HAVE A MISCARRIAGE FROM STARVATION.

She says its for the protection of everyone involved and has often been a major point FOR reunification.

But it does make one wonder expecially all the tv shows talk about foster/adopted children killing, or hurting some way the family. It does make one stop and worry. I know there are no garantees in life.:confused:  Arizona....While I understand your wondering what the chances are that a child might turn out \"very badly\" due to emotional baggage, the truth is no one except God knows IMHO, and we all have baggage. Prisons around the world are full of kids from \"good strong biological 2 parent families\". I just think to assume that because a child is part of the \"system\" and in need of a new family is no reason to think they may become criminals in the future. I am an AA female and assumptions have been made about me all of my life and it stinks. Most are stupid myths that don't relate to me at all...(OK the J-Lo butt part is true LOL.) I think if it were simply a matter of foster kids being predisposed to murder we could brand them or tie big cow bells around their necks and cut the crime rate in half instantly... Missy M  \n",
      "Originally posted by vicrose   But, I for one can say...I annoyed my aparents as a teen..and vice versa they annoyed me...but I never once thought about killing them. Hugs, Brenda  Heck Brenda.....I thought about killing mine once a day from the age of 14 on! Great post....Missy M \n",

      "acleeWell if the trend toward racial ambigous people continues I guess we can count on Matty having potential as a news anchor. Which might just be perfect since the kid is never quiet and he seems to have an opinion on just about everything. I totally see DD doing this in the future. Sometimes with her play acting she'll gather some papers and sit in a chair and start off with her tag line...Welcome to the Local 8 News. It's so cute to see her do this. Katie Couric has nothing on this girl. ;)  \n",
      "I had no idea Slash was bi-racial either especially under that massive amount of hair. To be honest I don't know if I've ever really had a good look at his face.  I love people that go out of the norm. My DD is multi-racial and her genre of music is as bround as her ethnicity. She is well versed in anything from disco (Shake your Booty) to smooth Jazz (Alexander Zonjic) to R&B (Alicia Keys & Beyonce) to 70's rock (Peter Frampton) and of course and especially ANYTHING from High School Musical and Cheetah Girls.:rockband:  It is my understanding that many artists who do well come from a background of multi-genre music. We absoutely love music in this house.  \n",
      "KLL08[quote=SHD]So on point, The night DD told me she felt like she didn't fit in there was nothing I could say or do. She was inconsolable. Daddy was the only person who could help her and he was at work so I called and he talked with her about how she was feeling. He totally \"got it\" and I totally didn't because *I* am the faces of the kids in her class. All I could do was sit on the sideline while they related their stories back and forth. As a mother I felt like a failure but loved the fact she had someone to turn to. DH later told me it's a horrible feeling be \"the only\" in a class of many. KWIM? QUOTE]I haven't finished the thread yet, but saw this and totally started tearing up...My husband and I are both CC and DD is AA. This is why we chose open adoption. Because neither of us will totally \"get it\" when DD comes home from school or somewhere and has had a bad day and doesn't feel like she fits in. I hope that our relationship with her first mom continues to grow so she can have a Mom that \"gets it\". It was a totally surreal moment. I knew the importance of having role models in my DD's life (and the fact that her main role model is her Daddy helps) but this really hit home. Having someone there for your child is of the utmost importance and I hope a relationship with her first mom works out for all of you.  \n",

If you're looking for realistic ethnic dolls, these are really good. I do wish though that they weren't just girls, would be nice to see some boy dolls, besides babies. Very cool! :love:  \n",
      "Seriously!! Ridlicious! I agree with the others, if after two years they can't get it right it's time to move on.  I have a similar story. When DD was born we went to our (then) pedi and I explained DD was adopted, blah, blah. I mostly took her for her visits but one day DH took her. They had never seen him before so they called me. I'm glad they were aware someone other than me was bringing DD to the doctor but like you said, we don't randomly pick up sick kids and take them to their physician. *SHEESH*  \n",
      "BetelnutTo me the comment is sort of offensive--not really racist but on the edge. I hear it as, \"Of course he likes that kind of music--it's in his genes!\"  What if your son had said he liked Mozart or Pete Seeger? Would your co-worker have said, \"Wow, that's so white of him!\"? I have to say I agree with Betelnut. So if your son plays sports is this also going to be another \"black\" thing?  I also agree with Supa, it totally depends on who says it and how they say it. Daddy can say certain things and it's funny, but, if one of my co-workers says the same thing I hit the roof. You say the person who made the comment is a friend and knows your journey then maybe there was no malintent. I wouldn't let someone, even someone close to me, get too comfortable saying off-handed remarks because then they are treading on thin ice. Meaning, it could become offensive if they get too okay with what is being said and not corrected. You know your friend/co-worker so how do you feel it was said? Did you discuss it with him? Maybe he meant nothing but I would at least say something to him to clear up any future misunderstandings. Good luck.  \n",
      "This is a tough one. As mentioned by a PP, some people are unaware of the association and some in the younger generation seem clueless and just don't care.  I was in a similar situation myself. DD was in The Wizard of Oz and I let her play any role she wanted EXCEPT the monkey. While the kids were trying out for various roles I sent Daddy a text and asked what he thougt. He sent back two words...NO WAY! She didn't understand (she was 5 at the time) and it was too deep to explain to her so I just told her I would tell her later which satisfied her at the time and she hasn't said anything since.  If you're not comfortable ask if she can be assigned a different role. You are going to have a whole life of this type of stuff whether it be intentional or overt it's best to confront it now. Good luck!  \n",
      "I heard this when Roland Martin reported it on The Tom Joyner Morning Show. They were pretty upset but of course they had jokes. They said Don Imus was probably sitting back saying, SHEW!  I've never listened to her but with the company she keeps I never felt the need to seek her out.  I agree with everything BB said. Seriously, can someone really be that dumb? She thought it was okay to say what she was saying because she saw some commediens on HBO? Since when did a comedy skit set the tone for the whole world? Oy!  Crick, you are so right. I forgot all about her outrage over the use of the R word. Does the shoe fit when it's on the other foot?  \n",
      "This made me smile. ;) Just too hilarious! We had a similar thing happen to us last year at softball. Big Girl was playing outside of the dugout between innings. She fell in the gravel and skinned her knee pretty good. Daddy picked her up, held her in his arms and carried her over to me. He stood there a bit and saw she was okay then sat back down. I had to work OT that night so before the game was over I said my good-byes to Big Girl and other softball moms/dads. A couple sitting near us witnessed the whole thing asked, who's going to watch your daughter? Um, her Dad, the one who held her in his arms when she fell. DUH!!! :arrow: Gwen, that has got to be one of the funniest things I have ever heard! My man was trying to score a hook-up and you shot him down. When Big Girl was younger I use to get \"that look\" you know the one, but if I get them now I don't notice it anymore.  \n",

Daddy sometimes gets those looks from CC people when I'm not around.  SHD - I'm surprised they said that to you because you and hubby could def be big girl bio parents. That's what I thought. It's obvious even though she's light in comparison to a full AA person she still has features that anyone can see are AA.  \n",

      "bromanchikAs a white mother of white children who is vehemently anti-racist, I too, have gotten good at knowing who to talk to and who to keep my kids away from. While racism has not been directed at my children, I do my best to not expose them to people with those beliefs. When we do encounter them I tend to confront and then to rant, so my kids see how to handle these things as well as how I feel.  I don't think it is good for children, whatever their race, to see racism accepted by their parents inaction... action means removing them from the situation or avoiding it in the first place. So very true. Even if I had a CC husband and child I would still feel as strongly as I do now.  \n",
      "The woman was being obviously obtrusive and nosy. Once you answered her first question she should have stopped there. Your answers are good and like Alcee said, answer depending on your mood. One pat answer that usually stops people dead in their tracks is, why do you ask? If they don't have an explaniation then the 20 questions will stop. If they are genuinely interested (suspect Stormie is adopted and they are looking to have a family) then they'll open up and tell you their reasons for asking. BTW, very cute pic. :)  \n",

      "millie58In this society, CC's don't have to look at race. AA's don't have that luxury. We're reminded of race every day. Great point! I saw an interview on 60 Minutes a few years back discussing how AA people are moving back to the south. They had a diverse group of individuals in different fields of work. One woman was a judge and stated when she was in her courtroom she got all kinds of respect. Quite another story when she was in the outside world. She said, \"I don't have to look at my hands to know I'm black.\"  \n",
      "SleeplvrI think a lot times if you are mixed with something other than white it's ignored. People focus on skin color and hair texture not necessarily features. My DD is black and Asian and to the casual observer or people who are not used to that combination all they see is a little black girl with small eyes. Asians spot it every single time. My DD is the SAME way! When she is standing amongst friends who are AA she looks exactly like her friends. We also have a friend who is AA/Japanese and when we are with her and her family DD fits in with them. She is a chameleon.  We also are friends with a family that Dad is CC and Mom is from Malyasia. When I told her DD was MR she was utterly shocked because she only sees the Asian in her. Her DD and my DD look like they could be sisters! Just another case of so many races joined together one never knows who the child will look like.  \n",
      "Bethany, Nick and Sleep you all have stated exactly what I feel, think and live. Well said. Amen to you all. Saj, these ladies are very knowledgable. I also hope things work out for you.

      "My daughter went on a field trip this past summer to Greenfield Village in Dearborn where \"THE\" Rosa Parks bus is on display. One night at dinner she told us about a bus she saw where, \"Mommy would sit in the front and she and Daddy would have to sit in back.\" She then paused and said, \"Well, since I'm a little bit black and a little bit white I would sit in the middle.\" I totally forgot the bus would be something they would see on their trip. I was not surprised to hear that the narrator of their trip didn't explain that while that was a rule at the time the rule was wrong. Daddy and I tried to discuss this with her by asking her \"what if Mommy and Daddy wanted to sit together?\" She, at the time, had just turned 6 so she was focusing on following the rules. She does know that he was shot and killed. We plan to continue to discuss race with her and graduate our talks as she gets older.  Unfortunately this will not be the only discussion we have with her. She's also Na.Am. and Japanese so we will have to explain how the first citizens of this country were driven out and how during WWII people of Japanese descent were sent to inturnment (sp?) camps. Yucky stuff but it's part of her history, her past.  So sad to hear Nick what your son got from his \"history\" class. You are right but that's what it appears like. I didn't learn about the many contributions of AA until my adulthood. I dare say I'm still learning about them. You're right Sleeplvr, education must be subsidised at home with our own field trips, books and movies. And Supa, Happy Loving Day! *wink* (I know its not until June but still an important part of history)  \n",

      "First of all, this is a very important vent so don't think I'm (I'll just speak for myself) bored with it. Second, I'm so sorry this has happened to you.  I have to admit I like DH's response of loudly proclaiming, \"She's white.\"  I agree with Pennies, start touching her hair or her children's hair. That might get the point across as to how invasive this action is.  With the \"she's not their mom\" comment I'll assume there was a conversation about you within earshot so don't know what to tell you about that. Sometimes it gets tiresome trying to educate ignorance. :grr:  We are our children's role model so taking the high road sometimes is very difficult. Our kiddos need to learn these comments/actions are unacceptable and how they respond to them is very important. It will empower them to confront offenders. While one can never anticipate something like this happening keep coming here to get ideas on what to do. I myself have been caught off guard very often and get frustrated about what I could have or should have said or done. I try to look at it like this, each time something happens it prepares me better for the next time. Sad we have to think about stuff like that but unfortunately we do. :( I need to be better at reacting because my DD is getting older and more observant so I need to prepare her for what will (unfortunatly not if) something happens. Keep up the good work and kiss all three of those little cuties cuz they have GREAT parents!  \n",

She/He might be able to go through a beauty supply shop like Maly's for you to get the professional set. My DBF cuts his sons' hair and that's what he uses. Do you have a beauty school near you? Maybe start taking all of your kids there and get their hair done and once the hairdresser you like graduates you can follow them to their new shop.  Just throwing out ideas. Good luck to you.  \n",

As a matter of fact when Bmom filled out paperwork the first time she didn't mention the NA but the second set of papers she mentioned it. I'm not sure if she was worried about the ICWA. I'll have to get a genentic test on DD to find out for sure which will give me a yes or no on NA.  Good luck, just make sure your I's are dotted and your T's are crossed.

From my experience the word black is not offensive at all EXCEPT if it's used in a dirogitory manner. Correct me if I'm wrong Manni but I think that's what you're referring to. My Bfriend uses the term black because being AA that's the term he grew up using. Around DD we interchange both terms, but we use black most often.  \n",

      "Q, I didn't get a chance to read your link to the Newsweek article but saved it in my favorites to read later. Before I had a chance to read it NPR did a report on it last week. I found it very interesting. It also came in a rather timely moment for my family. My daughter went to Greenfield Village in Dearborn, MI this summer. She didn't find it fascinating so we didn't discuss it at length. One evening at dinner she told her father and me when she went to the \"back then museum\" this summer they had a bus (THE bus, Rosa Parks) and on this bus black people had to sit in the back and white people sat in the front. She explained how she and Daddy would sit in back while I sat in front. Then she changed it and said she would sit in the middle. (she's becoming more aware of her racial makeup) It didn't occur to either of us to say that the rules \"back then\" were wrong. I kept asking her what if Daddy and I wanted to sit together and wanted her with us. In her mind (she's 6) these were the rules and we have to follow the rules. This study made me realize I need to be more proactive in how I discuss race with her. While she knows she is made up of many races/ethnicities I haven't discussed with her the sad parts of her past. When is old enough? Her father discussed it with his older kids when they were her age. He has some video from PBS that he shared with them so he's getting it out for her.  Thanks Q and Cubana for posting this.  \n",
      "I haven't read all the posts yet but I want to put in my $.02 (which is probably what it's worth) My DD is multi-racial. Her eyes are so brown they look black, one can barely see the pupil. (she is AA/Asian/NaAm/Italian that combination of brown eyes makes her eyes very dark) When CC people look at her they are not sure which ethnic pigeon hole to put her in but one thing is for certain, THEY KNOW SHE'S NOT WHITE. People are not given a \"pass\" if they don't look all the way black. I must teach DD what people see when the look at her.  The eyes are only a small part of the genetic trail. Don't let them fool you.  Great discussion and very strong opinions. Can't wait to read the rest.  \n",

      "OK I missed the boat twice. :( With your description she sounds like her hair is similar to DD's hair. I think the only difference may be is DD's hair is very thick. My BFriend would ask on occasion just how long I wanted it to get. I kept going until it got too much for both she and I to cope with. When we did cut it we sent it to Lock of Love. Yes, it was long enough that it met the required 10inches and she had the cutest little bob afterwards. Now that she's 6 her hair gets cut when she asks about it. My DD loves her hair and is starting to realize she has options such as going curly one day and straight the next.  I say keep growing it until combing out the tangles get to be too much for the both of you. Once the labor of love becomes a labor then it's time but until then let it grow. Don't let others determine your DD's hair.  Good luck to you.  \n",
      "I understand where you are coming from. DD is multi-racial and we have friends who are of various races and ethnicities. Our friends who are AA see the AA in her right away but we have one friend who is Malaysian (sp?) and she only sees the Asian not the AA while yet another friend is both Japanese/AA and she sees both in DD. I strongly believe that like you were saying that folks can spot their own. I agree that this woman did not mean any malice just drawing from her own racial identity and seeing it in you DS. (handsome little prince by the way) If you are curious I know I've seen on this board where you can get DNA testing that will give you your answers. From what I understand it will not give you exact specifics it will let you know if he has Asian in his genetic makeup.  I have to say I don't generally use the term mixed but understand that on occasion it is ok to use. To me it depends on the way in which the term is used. When DD was first born a woman whose nails I did referred to her as \"potpourri\" and when I asked her what she meant (I really knew but wanted to torture myself by asking her) and she said, you know she's mixed. I told her that mix is what you do to a cake and my daughter was no cake. She stuttered and stammered and NEVER made that mistake again.  It is amazing to me that people of color often can see their own in my DD she is rarely identified correctly by CC people. They often think of her as Hispanic. I just know her friends who are of Latin decent immediately know she's not H.  \n",

When I was dd's age I was so girly girl, I loved all that dressing up, makeup, beehive hairdo, etc. When dd was 3 years old I steared her towards the darker skinned princesses. Her first costume was Jasmine and over the past three years she has accumulated Mulan and Pocahontas. She still loves the \"blonde\" princesses but I've come to realize, like the others, it's all about the pink and the frufru. I figure no harm no foul. She still loves the princesses at age six but has since gravitated towards High School Musical. She realizes she looks more like Gabriella but she loves Sharpay, reason being...PINK. I'm proud to also say she is one of the biggest Spiderman fans the world has ever seen. She even went so far as to have Spidey be the theme of her fifth birthday party. Her daddy even got her a Spiderman bicycle that she proudly rides around town. I don't think that the \"I need a man to be someone\" has resiginated with her.  Samantha my dd also refers to blonde hair as \"yellow.\" Kids are so funny how they call it like they see it. DD is multi-racial and she'll tell you in a minute she's six colors. ;)  \n",

This woman simply wanted two sisters to live in the same household and help them in their time of need. Pretty crazy. My agency itself didn't suggest any classes but I had already taken several ahead of time in anticipation. I knew that I could turn to my DBfriend or close friends for help in raising an AA child but I wanted to be prepared myself. Little did I know the child God would send to me would be multi-racial and I would have a other things I need to think about and teach her.  Sugar, my DBfriend and I were shocked at how few AA donors there were available while we were going through fertility treatments. You're right, not a lot out there.  \n",
      "Thanks for the update. Stay strong. I'll be thinking of you on Friday. :clap:  \n",
      "I read this thread when it first came out but didn't have a chance to comment. I guess there's no need to now.  I agree with the others, WOW! is all I can say. She buried herself but good. Glad you don't have to put up with that nonsense anymore Gwen. I think you did all the right things to try to get her to see how ignorant her comments were. The part about \"not talking about your family\" is ridlicious. We're all part of a broader family so yes, she meant your family. Take care.  \n",
      "I met a mom at DD's daycare that once we got talking we figured out both of our kiddos are adopted. She has a son so now that they are six years old their interests are definitely leaning towards their gender. She's TOTALLY dress up, makeup and hair and he's TOTALLY girls have cooties so we haven't done a whole lot lately. I can't wait for my trip to Columbus when I can meet Joskids and now Cjmeck I find out you're pratically a neighbor also. :grouphug: I live in Michigan on the border so both of you are only a couple of hours away. I have a girlfriend that lives in Columbus also that when I have been to visit her I'm so jealous that she lives in this world. Columbus is truly a melting pot.  Good luck at meeting the mom at the pool again. Since you're both members of the Y perhaps, in a non-stalkerish kind of way, ask other members if they know who she is and perhaps you can get a little more info on her. Maybe even show up at the same time again and you might run into her.  \n",
      "My DD has a tan color to her skin. When she is around folks that are AA it is obvious that she is AA and at the same time when she is around folks of Asian decent it's obvious she's Asian. She has a TON of hair and it's VERY curly. It's long right now so the weight pulls some of the curls down but when it is short it is very curly. Actually she has hair women pay big money to have.  When she was first born she had the mongolian spots but they seem to have faded unless the rest of her skin color has caught up to the shade of the spots. One of the nurses in the maternity ward pointed them out to me because they do look like bruises. She wanted me to know about them so that when I got home and took her to my own ped then I would be aware and make her doctor aware.  Sleeplvr thanks for the DNA testing site. Very interesting. I would like to do this for DD one day. I know for fact that Bmom is AA and Asian but she mentioned NaAm from her own father's side and I would like to know if that is true simply because I feel I owe it to DD to know for sure ALL of her ethnicity.  \n",
      "Just took the survey. Lots of luck and Happy New Year!  \n",
      "My DD's eyes are black. I know that may not make sense but her brown is so brown you can barely make out the pupil. My girlfriend and her husband's children were born in S. America and she said the people in that region refer to it as black eyes. DD has a lot of people in her background that have brown eyes, AA, Na.Am, Asian, and Italian. They have been that way since the day she was born and haven't changed. She even refers to her eye color as black because that is the way she sees them.  \n",
      "Congrats! You are truly blessed! Don't know what to tell you about the closed adoption but perhaps time will tell.  \n",
      "Congratulations on a beautiful baby boy. I'm so happy for you. You're so right, you were meant to be Jacobi's mom and dad. You're all fortunate in this triad. All my best to you.  \n",
      "I must say I agree with the previous posters. I just recently left my hairdresser after being a customer/friend for the past 25+ years. He sent me an email of a \"joke\" to say the least. I emailed him back that I didn't want to receive anymore \"jokes\" like this again and it was offensive not only to me but to my DBfriend and DD. He returned with a \"Oh, get over it! I'm not talking about your bfriend or child.\" It's sad that he doesn't even realize how wrong he is. My bfriend said he wanted to go in with me on my next appointment and say something to him. I told him it wouldn't do any good because I am not going back. I haven't seen or heard from my hairdresser since, so much for our friendship.  These are the types of choices you as a parent and a steward of human nature must make. They are tough ones but they MUST be made.  Good luck and I'll be thinking of you and your family not only with your friends but until your baby girl is in your arms.  \n",
      "Congrats Dalene for having that first all important talk. It's nice to hear she was willing to sit and listen to how you feel rather than getting defensive. Hopefully she can learn a little from this whole situation too. I'm glad it worked out for you.  Thanks Celesyee, it was a difficult decision to make but like you said, sometimes it has to be done.  \n",
      "Thank you so much for bringing this article to my attention! I am all too aware that white privilege exists. I knew it was out there but since my DBfriend and I have been together it's really been put in my face. When he and I have been together in restaurants, when he returned some articles to a store and I returned some items before him the opposite ways in which we were treated. I've even been out with a group of women and I was the only CC in the group, totally ignored until someone got up and got the waitress. The first thing she said when taking our order was, \"You go girl.\" OMG!  SupaModel, Makarios I totally understand (can I say that being a white girl?:) ) what you are talking about with the light/dark debate. My DD is multi-racial so CC people think she is Latina. I want her to understand that she is Black/NaAm/Asian/CC and while some folks think she is cute, unfortunately some day, somewhere, somebody will remind her she's not ALL WHITE. I want her to be ready for that, is that ever possible to be totally prepared? I would like to see it all end in my lifetime but I don't see it happening. I'm not trying to be negative but when the young cashier at the store asks me if my DD is \"mixed\" and I tell her yes her response is, \"At least she doesn't have the hair.\" Unfortunately I was so stunned by her comment I just froze and didn't have a quick reply. This was a young girl who will probably send that same message to her children when she has a family. And so it continues.... God bless us all and keep up the good work ladies, this topic needs to be aired and hopefully we can be advocates for a change.  \n",
      "I agree with everyone else here. My DD is multiracial but people who share her ethnicity KNOW who she is and remark about it.  I remember giving blood one time and most of the people that worked for the Red Cross were AA women. They made sweet comments about DD and the subject turned to her hair, she has a TON of curly hair, and I was explaining to the lady taking my blood what I do to take care of her hair but then noticed that several of the other ladies were listening to my description. They all nodded in approval and I left feeling wonderful two ways, one for my blood donation and the other that I was doing the right thing with her hair. WHEW!  \n",
      "I agree with those of you who find the word offensive and understand the derogatory history of this word. What kids need to know is that many people died in VERY unpleasant ways to keep from being called this name. How dishonorable to them, their struggle and their memory to \"change the meaning\" of this horrible word. The meaning will NEVER change. I can't tell people of color how to feel but my Bfriend (who is AA) has NEVER used the word nor does he find anything positive in being allowed to be called such a word. For the life of either one of us we can't understand how this came about. Our DD will learn about the word and that it is/was/will be an offensive word with offensive intent attached to it.  \n",
      "I'm agree with the others, I'm sorry that this happened to you. I too have had comments out of the blue said to me and it totally took my feet out from under me. I just stood there stunned and like you cried when the realization that some ignorance slipped out of someone's brain then out of their mouth. I can't really give you any advice because one never knows when this kind of nonsense blindsides you. I can only say stay strong for your son because he is going to need it when he is confronted with this kind of junk.  \n",
      "Thursday I had a minor urgency at my house so my next door neighbors watched DD while I attended to the matter. It was a nice day so they were enjoying the weather on their front porch when a friend stopped by to chat. At some point in the visit he looked at DD and asked who she looked like, Mommy or Daddy. She very boldly looked at him and said, \"I look like ME.\" Since I wasn't there I was especially proud of her and her response. I just had to share this with folks who would understand. Thanks for letting me share.  \n",
      "Congrats, I've been kind of busy lately so haven't checked in to keep track. Enjoy every moment, even those sleepless nights. I still remember them like it was yesterday. We would sit in the rocking chair in the wee hours of the morning just drinking it all in. I'm truly happy for you. :love:  Helayne  \n",
      "No, you were not wrong to be offended. It was meant to be offensive disguised as a joke. My theory is that with every \"joke\" the truth lies within. Yes, indeed do say something for yourself and your child. To me (and this is just my 2cents) you don't need to say what minority or even if you child is a minority for you to tell someone that a \"joke\" is offensive. There have/are times when I am so shocked that a comment is said I get blindsided and have nothing to say BUT other times the little hairs on the back of my neck stand on end and I let loose.  Good luck to you and your family.  \n",
      "I just had to share this to get it off my chest. My boyfriend and I both shopped a major department store to buy our daughter some clothes for Christmas. We each went to the same store but in different cities. We put our purchases together and went through the outfits and sizes deciding what we wanted and didn't want. We went to the store where I made my purchsaes to make our returns. Before we went into the store he checked his wallet to make sure he had everything necessary to make a return, receipt, id and credit card. I asked why he was rechecking himself when he knew he had this stuff when we left the house. I am CC and he is AA. We have been together for a dozen years and I have seen my share of nonsense but I've never been to a store with him to make a return. His comment to me was, \"I'm going to have to school you.\" We waited in line and I went first. I told the clerk (an elderly CC woman) that we made double purchases so I needed to make a return. She went through my receipt, made the returns and told me to have a nice day. I was never once asked for id, credit card, phone number, nothing. My DBF steps up to make his returns and we were there for fifteen minutes! She wanted his phone number then pointed out that he went to another city to buy these clothes, then she wanted the expiration date on his credit card, then finally asked for some id and he refused. I can't say I blame him when he stood there and watched me fly through my return in two minutes. She called a manager over and told him that he didn't want to give an id so she said to do it without a receipt which would only allow him store credit. He told her there was no way he was going to get store credit when he has a receipt right in front of her. After the manager left the clerk claimed to do an override and credited his card. There was a barcode on the receipt that told her everything she needed to know and was on the screen. She even knew the expiration date on his card but claimed that the computer was telling her to ask these questions.  I know some of you are probably saying that we should have gotten a manager but after talking to the one we knew it would get us any satisfaction. He didn't want to get loud but he didn't want to blow it off. He wasn't exactly silent at the cash register either but he wasn't screaming and making a scene. He said this happens everytime he returns something so he has become an avid receipt saver until the item is so used it can't be returned.  I later discussed it with a mom whose family we have become close to at DD's daycare. She said she's had situations similar to this. I just hate the fact that DD is going to have to grow up and go through this ignorance.  The whole thing is just so crazy! I'm not ignorant when it comes to racist situations but to take a walk in someone else's shoes one day is something we all should experience.  Thanks for lending an ear (eye) I needed to unload.  \n",
      "Wow Teendoc, great post! Yes, these awful things happen to the folks we love everyday. As far as the \"couldn't it have been\" portion, my theory is this, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. That's my way of saying yes, they meant what they said. The reason for the paranoia is because it happens ALL the time, it's not unfounded. I really dislike the fact that this is something that I MUST teach my DD. My wishing it to go away is not working so I must be proactive.  I wholeheartedly agree with you BethanyB, sometimes it is so hard and tedious to educate others that at times it's best to bend an ear that knows where I'm coming from. This is why I come here, for some relief.Take care everyone  \n",
      "Blessed, I totally feel where you are coming from. My daughter is not only multiracial she is multicultural. DD is AA/CC/Na.Am(Blackfoot)/Asian(Japanese)/Jamacian/Italian. I too want to keep all of her ethnicity and cultures alive. What is amazing to me is that folks who are AA recognize her to be AA right away and same with people of Asian decent. I even had one woman who is of Phillpino decent not recognize any ethnicity in her other than her Asian look.  I feel comfortable here because I get advise from others who understand my DD and what she will go through in life. I agree with Cubana, transracial is transracial.  Feel free to PM me if you would like. Unfortunately my DD is not registered with her Nation and after having spoken with an individual from NAIA it appears it's going to be difficult to do so. She's only four so hopefully I'll be able to get more information as time goes on.  \n",
      "Alcee I thought the exact same thing! Is this her sister?!  I haven't read all the way through but I have to agree with what I have seen. It's about them and their future baby. You have a good start to educating yourself by logging onto this site. You'll find lots of advice here.  There will be a new baby in your family soon so be the best aunt you can be. Good luck.  \n",
      "I too remember your journey and am so happy for you and your family! I can appreciate your semtiment of being the fortunate parents, I feel the same way about my big girl. Helayne  \n",
      "Hello and welcome. First, my prayers go out to you for your journey. I agree with the others. The two books listed are excellent. If you live anywhere near a large city there will be more than likely all types of cultural events happening throughout the year. Go to the website of the largest city near you and check out their happenings around town. Yes, making friends with someone who is AA just because of their color is odd but like a previous poster advised, if you start going to some events you're going to recognize faces and perhaps just be drawn to each other due to your common interests. Yes, you are going to get some strange comments along the way but unfortunately the whole world doesn't see things the way we do.  All the best to you. One piece of advice I can give you is to keep in touch with this and other forums like this one and you can certainly get help from others. Helayne  \n",
      "Last night my daughter and I experienced a cultural event of a lifetime. We attended a concert from The African Children's Chorus. It was wonderful, but it was also a mix of emotions. The children are brought into the choir when one or both of their parents have passed away. Most of these parents are lost to AIDS. This choir has been going on for a little over thirty years. They are a very talented group and show all sorts of songs and dance from Africa. They discuss the different cultures within Africa and they talk about some of the turmoil that goes along with life in their homeland. My daughter began the evening as any 4 1/2 year would, a little antsy, not sitting in her seat for more than two seconds but once the lights went down and the music began she was totally engrossed. By the time intermission came she wanted to know when it was her turn to go on stage and dance and began dancing in the lobby. When we returned to our seats she was still dancing and fell asleep in my arms fighting her yawns to watch the entire show. I was so happy I brought her but then my own heart ached for these kids and others like them, not just in Africa but around the world including outside of my own doors.  If anyone gets a chance to see this show I highly recommend it. Should they come around again as she gets older we will be sure to go see it again.  Helayne  \n",
      "I think you did an excellent job! I also like the comment stating that you could not look your daughter in the face without saying this. It really drives the point home. I myself have had ridlicious comments said to me. I'm more prepared for people I know to say something but when a stranger blindsides me I'm blown away and left standing with my mouth hanging wide open. Like a previous poster noted, we can become a Mama lion when we need to. Unfortunately this is just a taste of what the future will bring so I try to arm myself so that I'm not blindsided and have an answer for the ridlicious.  Keep up the good work and that little dollface will know what to say because you taught her how to stand up for herself. Take careHelayne  \n",
      "I have a book that is not exactly a children's book but it shows families, ALL families. The name is Why I Chose You, 100 Reasons Why Adopting You Made Us a Family. It's not a story book but it shows pictures of different families and how they became a family.  Another interesting book is Feathers & Fur by Audrey Penn. It's not about people, rather a cat who helps a nest of ducklings hatch after their parents were blown away in a storm. The babies take a liking to the cat and ask their parents of he can stay. More of a foster story but it does point out that love has no boundaries. Hope this helps. Helayne  \n",
      "For me it was a matter of comfort. I am extremely comfortable around AA people. I feel accepted and am generally happier.  I don't know if I have just surrounded myself with a bunch of negative individuals in the past but my own family places demands on how they think I should look, dress, act and accept situations. I married a guy that put demands on how I should look, dress, act and accept situations. Once I shed the extra weight of their issues I began looking for people I had something in common with. Now my world is totally diverse and I'm much happier. It only made sense that any child that came into my life be just as diverse.  I didn't realize that an AA/BR/MR adoption was cheaper or less wait time. Both of these worked out to my advantage.  My Bfriend is AA so we have had our share of racial injustices towards us but have handled them fine. I feel that there will be times when my DD runs into her own injustices that I can't imagine but he is definitely there for her so therefore she will have someone to relate with on any problems. God willing there will be none but I must be a realist. Very thought provoking question. Helayne  \n",
      "Hi Alcee, I want to congratulate you on your choice to adopt. WOW! that's great!  To me adoption isn't a second choice. God has laid out a plan for you, DH and future baby. I look at my adoption situation like this, He put me through all of this (infertility issues) to find out where my heart was and when He saw that a child is what I truly desired He made a way for me to become a MOM.  I don't necessarily have the best relationship with my sibs or parents so during my adoption journey I didn't tell anyone but my niece. I mentioned it to my sis one time about adoption and the first thing she said was, well, you know what's going to happen don't you? You'll get pregnant. How rude!  I also didn't tell that I planned on adopting transracially because my family too is \"archie bunkerish.\" After my daughter was born I did tell my family about her diverse ethnicity only because I thought/think that it's pretty exciting. Two of my sis had the nerve to break down into percentage a description of her ethnicity. Ugh! My parents think my daughter is just the \"cat's pajamas\" and almost act like she's their only grandchild. The relationship with the sibs is not repaired so they don't even know her. I am not worried about that b/c I only want positive people in DD's life so I had to make a choice.  You and DH will do fine by your future little bundle. Don't let others and their lack of knowledge get you down. You'll make great parents and any child would be happy to call you MOM and DAD.  Keep us up on your progress, I'm anxious to know how it's going. Got you in my prayers!Helayne  \n",
      "We have had our share of ignorant comments and you would think that by now (DD is 4yrs old) I would be use to it. We got a comment at a store one time where a woman (she worked at the store) asked why my daughter was half black and did I like black guys. I was just so shocked that I didn't answer her but when I got to the service desk I asked to speak to the person in charge. One of the other workers had already summoned the manager. I was furious but moreso at myself for not having a response. The manager applogized and told me the woman was mentally challenged and that she would talk to her. I still wish I had responded!  I have gotten the \"are you grandma?\" comment only once so far. I'm 43 and at the time I was ONLY 39. I just looked at the young lady and said, \"Girl, how old do you think I am?\" She aplogized but then turned around and asked if my DD was \"mixed?\" Oy vay! I have as of recently decided to take the Mary Poppins approach. We watch that a lot at our house. When Mr. Banks asked her to explain herself she responded with a \"Let me make myself perfectly clear.\" (then in a calm smile) I never explain anything.\" To which Mr. Banks stood there with his mouth all agape.  My DD also shocked a casual observer at the doctor's office one time. She is very outgoing and her personality just draws people in by how charming she is. She was reading magazines and making up stories to each picture and explaining them to a gentleman. He asked her if she had any brothers or sisters and her response was yes, their names are S and J then quickly added and when I was a baby I was in T's belly. His face read a million different thoughts! He just looked at me and said \"Is she not your daughter?\" I told him she was but he still had a pained look on his face and I just told him she was adopted but he still looked perplexed but I let him stay that way. As someone stated earlier, if someone is going to be a part of my life then perhaps an explaniation is ok but passers thru don't need to know that much about us. Hope my long drawn out story has helped. I think you made the right choice to pick your battles. Keep up the good work. Helayne  \n",
      "I've been thinking about this thread today and another thought I have is this, sometimes it's not necessary to educate the world b/c it is our children's own personal story. Yes, it would be nice if everyone \"got it\" but they don't. I want my daughter to learn there are boundries and she doens't have to educate everyone with her private history. I don't mean to come across as being brash or rude but there are aspects of my daughter's life that I want her to know before anyone else. If I teach her there are lines now she will know in the furture where people are allowed to cross and where they are not. Does this make sense to anyone?  Once again, don't feel bad about not educating one person, that was just not your day to be an advocate. I think you did the right thing. Helayne  \n",
      "I'm very pleased with my agency. When the first situation didn't work out, something that was out of everyone's control, they started showing my profile all over again and I got a call within a week. The SW gave me every number conceiveable to reach her whenever I needed to. Actually this SW was the one assigned to my DD's Bmom. I was happy with the SW assigned to me but this woman was so helpful we just kept in very close contact. After placement she was still there for me. She called almost everyday while waiting for the ICPC to go through. Once home there were still phone calls. Now it's four years later and this specific SW is no longer works there but the agency is still there for me and also for DD's Bmom. I don't have to get in touch with them as urgently anymore so I email if I have a question with anything. I must say I was very happy with the whole siuation.  Helayne  \n",
      "I understand what you are going through. My mother keeps asking \"what\" DD is and my dad just says, \"She's American!\" Yes, she is but she has a background. My daughter is like yours LoveJax, very light skinned and I've had people ask if she is Latina. Of course it doesn't come out of their mouth that way but I digress. Our daughters can be what they are and our love is color blind but the world is not that way. I too let DD know she is AA/Na.Am./Asian (she is also CC/Italian) and while it's a bit much for a four year old to take in she is starting to recognize it in other people. She'll say, \"I'm like you.\" Sometimes folks are a little shocked but I hope they realize that I'm teaching her not to ignore who she is.  Keep up the good work, I agree that it's important that DD knows who she is b/c believe me, other people know.  Helayne  \n",
      "I have to say as a white mother I have appreciated NickChris and her responses. I am happy that my boyfriend can show my daughter some of the things that I could not possible teach her. There are things that we as CC people do not realize. I went out to eat with about ten AA women and we were totally ignored until someone got up and made the waitress come over and take our order. When she finally made her way over to us she asked if we were celebrating anything and she was told it was a bachlorette party. She asked who the bride was and when she replied the waitress told her, \"You go girl!\" We all immediately became silent and the bride's sister whispered to me, \"You got to earn that.\" Had I not been with these ladies I never would have believed that a large group or even one or two AA customers would be ignored so badly. I could not teach my daughter that unless I had witnessed it for myself. I've also been involved in other situations with my boyfriend that he's use to, not that he accepts them, he is just not as surprised as I am.  My daughter is similar to you TinaTyme. She is very light and I make sure she knows all of her race/ethnicity/culture. From what I have witnessed people of each race will remind her that she is part of them so I want her to know and respect each one.  After I read this post and put in a reply we went on an outing with a group of friends. The kids are aged 5,4 and 2. I brought some friends kids with me and one of the little girls pointed out that N and E were black. I just looked at her and asked what she was, E, without missing a beat, jumped in and said white. She just sat there like a deer in the headlights. It was almost as if it never occured to her that she might be different. Then she had to go even further into it by asking what my E was. I told her she was both black and white. That ended the conversation there because she really didn't know what to say or do.  I will never know truly what my boyfriend or unfortunately my daughter have/will go through but hopefully I can educate myself so that I can cushion the blow. In the meantime my boyfriend is black and my daughter is black/asian/na.am/cc. As she ages and as pointed out earlier in age appropriate terms explain the Jamacian, the Italian and even the difference between Japanese and Chinese.  I truly have my work cut out for me but having been around my boyfriend for so long helped me know that I can never be prepared for it all. There will always be something that comes up.  I have seen interviews with Halle Berry where she said her mother took a mirror and they both stood in front of it. Her mother asked her what she saw. Halle told her that she saw there was a difference between the two of them and her mother told her that is what everyone else sees also, she said learned a lot from that very simple act.  I'm sorry to see that some people have been offended by this thread but it is also a very tricky post.  I hope that folks don't stop talking because of it. I know everyone is trying very hard and are very good parents. Keep up the good work. Helayne  \n",
      "I've always heard that God doesn't give you more than you can handle so He must have very high regard for you. You are in my thoughts and prayers and like the others I hope that little Jennifer Catherine can prove the doctors wrong.  Helayne  \n",
      "LOL! I have already been accused of \"thinking I'm black\" before my daughter came into my life. My bfriend and another friend (both of which are AA) teased me when I loudly complained about some graffitti that was slanderous to the AA community. They teased me that they haven't even seen someone of their race get so upset about something like that. They were glad I did complain but it's just not something that a CC would normally do.  I don't really notice people looking whether it is positive or negative. I can see it happening but I just don't notice it.  I have a coworker friend who is a member of a church that is mostly AA. A couple often visits with their daughter who is AA. At first he said he \"kept and eye on them.\" He realizes now that this child is their daughter and nobody could tell this family differently. He admires the way they interact and he even mentioned that this little girl's hair is perfect every time he sees them. He's learned a lesson from this family. I only wish everyone could learn the same lesson and not be so quick to judge. Keep up the good work and don't let the outside world get you down. You are a family and that is all that matters Helayne PS Linny, your post about the gentleman at the hospital made me smile.  \n",
      "My experience was my homestudy was complete and written up in Febryary/March, my agency informed me about an emom who chose me about mid-March and my daughter was born mid-April. After staying in the state where she was born (ICPC took 11 days to clear) we were home a couple of days before May. Quite the whirlwind! I had nothing prepared because I didn't expect it to go so quickly. I had a few clothes and some friends said I could use their crib and bassinet. I had a shower once I got home and got settled in.  Best of luck and my prayers go out to you.Helayne  \n",
      "I too am under the impression that \"bi\" means just that, two. And \"multi\" means more than two. My agency has an \"agency-assisted program.\" They term that as any race with black. I never got the impression from them that they were going by bi or multi. My daughter is technically multiracial. She is AA/CC/Asian/Na.Am. I personally differentate race and culture. She is also Jamacian and Italian. To me these two are black and white. People that we come across that are black recognize their race in her as do people of Asian decent. She also looks like whomever she's around. She has baby dolls that are all different colors. When she has her light skinned black doll that's who she looks like but when she's holding her Mulan doll she looks like her. She also has a Pocahontas doll and costume that her Na. Am comes out when she has these with her. Because of these similiarties to the different races I let her know that she is all these people.  I personally don't care for the term \"mixed\" either. I actually got angry with a woman who called her \"hodge podge.\" I know what the term means but played stupid and asked her what she meant. She said, \"Well, she's mixed isn't she?\" I told her that mix is what you do to a cake and my daughter was not a cake. I told her that if she must refer to her by something other than a child she is multiracial.  It would be nice if people could look at children and just see a beautiful child rather than try to figure out how to pigeon hole them. One day, hopefully, this will happen. Helayne  \n",
      "I read in the June 11 issue of Jet magazine that Disney has updated their newest princess. We all know they have finally decided to have a black princess and she has had a name change and the title to the movie has changed. At first her name was going to be Maddy and now it is Princess Tiana and the new title is The Princess and the Frog. The actress who will play the princess is Anika Noni Rose. The movie is set to release in 2009. I look forward to this movie so all those little girls out there can have their very own princess! It's going to be hand-drawn like Disney's early movies rather than the computer animated ones. Yea Disney for moving forward! Helayne  \n",
      "I too am fortunate with my adoption story. My HS was done in February, I was matched in March and my DD was born in April. I actually had a situation that fell through because the paperwork from my HS had not been completed. I felt sad about that but I knew that it wasn't meant to be and within the week I was notified about my DD. Things happen as they are meant to be. My agency had an approximate timeline of six to nine months for BR/AA child. It turned out in my case the only reason it took as \"long\" as it did is because Bmom just had to deliver. Best wishes to you.  \n",
      "It probably is on purpose. I've been out to eat with a couple of friends of mine before (both AA) that I got to the restaurant before they arrived and was seated in an area with other CC customers. When my friends arrived we began eating and enjoying conversation when one of my friends noticed the hostess seating the AA customers on the other side of the restaurant. After noticing this we sat and watched the seating assignments and sure enough that side of the restaurant had nothing but AA sitting at the tables. We wondered where we would be sitting if one of my friends had arrived before I had. It's sad that these things happen but they do. Helayne  \n",

      "In my heart I wanted a girl but my boyfriend kept telling me I \"needed\" a boy. I guess it's a man thing with how boys feel about their moms even into adulthood. In my case my bmom didn't go to the doctor until her eighth month. My daughter was born healthy but bmom did find out the sex of the baby. The agency warned me that sometimes ultrasounds were incorrect so that I shouldn't get my hopes up. I would have been fine with a boy because I would accept anybody God chose to put in my life. I also would have been happy with a child that was full AA.  This is just my opinion but I feel like when we are not able to give birth to a child then sometimes we should be able to control something, e.g. sex of child, race, even where on the globe the child is born. That's just how I feel. Fortunately my wait from the time HS had been submitted it was three months. My SW did say that she had never heard of a match so quickly but that just told me that we were meant to be a family. God bless and prayers go out to you.Helayne  \n",
      "I have to say I was concerned about my parents also. I grew up in the south in the '70s so I know how they thought at one time. I think perhaps I did break my parents/sibs in slightly before my daugther came into my life, my bfriend is black. They seem ok with him so I didn't think there was much more about me that they didn't expect. My mother made a comment before about Japanese people and I let her know that kind of talk was unacceptable and would not be heard again. She hasn't said another derogatory comment since then. My social worker did touch on it just a bit but I think more so in the grand scheme of things, people in general along with family. The head of the HS agency did ask me how I felt I was qualified to raise a child of color and when I explained how diverse my life is she didn't need any more information. I do agree with the be honest approach. From the articles that I have read on transracial adoption that severing ties with friends and loved ones is always a possibility. My daughter is four years old and she is the light of my parents life. The absoutely love her to pieces and just fawn all over her.Good luck with the HS, it always feels good when that part is over. Helayne  \n",
      "I do experience AA women quick to chat with us also. My daughter is fairly light, more of a tan, but it is obvious to other AA that she is at least part AA. Even children her own age recognize it. We went to a blood drive where several AA women were working and they were very interested in how I take care of her hair. While she is part AA she is also It./Na.Am./Japanese. I believe that is the reason her hair seems more like that of a CC, the texture is not as coarse but very full and very curly. It made me feel good that they told me I was doing the right thing by just using conditioner, no shampoo, only about once a week and keeping it brushed out and rebraided. My bfriend is AA so our family sort of \"blends in\" with everyone else. Our town is small but pretty diverse. Our church with a predominately AA congregation welcomed us without hesitation. Feels good to be part of a larger familly :flowergift:  \n",
      "Those rough mommy days are frustrating. I can't help with the car seat but someone mentioned that when you are stressed the baby can feel it. Too true! Try the suggestion of a sling or a warm bath. Before we left the hospital a nurse told me that my daughter needed to get to \"know\" me. She told me that my daughter had been with her birthmother for nine months so she knew her heartbeat and her smell so it was time she knew my heart and smell. She suggested that we \"kangaroo\" in order to achieve this. We did skin to skin contact for a long time. It really helped soothe us both and I feel like it really helped with our bonding. Last night she told me, \"Mommy, I love you, you're my best friend!\" It will happen soon enough. As for the formula I agree that you should call your doctor and get their input. Good luck and try to relax as much as possible. Try low lights and soft music. Helayne  \n",
      "I agree with all the posts here. My daughter is as light as Cameron. She has gotten slightly more color since she was born, she's four now. In the summer even though I put a ton of spf 35 lotion she still gets darker. I've had to remove ignorant people from my life as well but as stated in an ealier post there are too many smart people out there to have as friends to hang onto the less informed ones. I also tell her she is adopted and we look at pictures of her birthfamily. We have also discussed her ethnicity and she has walked up to a stranger who is AA and tell them, \"I'm brown like you.\" I think that people are surprised but when I explain that we talk about her race they are ok with it. At least no one has said differently. A friend of mine who is AA asked me how I plan to raise her, I explained I discuss all of her ethnicity with her, she's multiracial. I will continue to discuss this because children her age realize that she is AA. My only difficulty is because she is so light and I am CC she sees herself as she sees me. My boyfriend is dark and she knows for fact that she doesn't look like him. I'm thinking that as long as I continue to discuss this with her and read our books on race she'll get that AA comes in many colors.  I don't know anything about your friends but if the husband is saying these things in front of you then more than likely he's VERY comfortable when you're not around.  Good luck and I think you're doing the right thing. Helayne  \n",
      "My daughter too has received white dolls that seem to disappear. I feel rude in my mind for accepting these dolls and then tucking them away or offering them to her daycare as a donation but I also don't see why people who give her these dolls don't realize that she is not white. We like Dora and the ethnic Disney princesses. She has Jasmine and Pocahontas costumes and asking for a Mulan costume. We also have the aforementioned books. Girls hold up this world is a wonderful book on so many levels, ethnic and girl power!  \n",
      "How exciting!!!!!!!! Enjoy the trip and cherish those first few days with baby before going home, family will be excited to see everyone. I can't wait for updates.:banana:  \n",
      "I am so excited for you!! My situation had a similarity to yours. A bmom accepted me but my HS was not complete so the agency could not complete the adoption. When the bmom found out that the baby was still in foster care she became very upset and everything fell through. I was crushed. Before the week was through my daughter's bmom chose me and we were matched! I went ahead and bought my pink stuff and she had an adorable little dress to wear back to the hotel. I stayed at the Candlewood for my wait for the ICPC and it was wonderful. They have portable cribs also. I think I recall that the laundry was free but I had to provide my own detergent. They also have a \"grocery store.\" If it's one of those days where you don't want to or can't leave the hotel they have basic supplies that they let you charge to your room. They also have some workout stuff. I sometimes walked on the treadmill. This is a hugely exciting time in your life. Once your child finds you the pain of the past is easier to cope with when you realize it is the path that has lead you to where you are today. I'm praying for the best for you and your husband. SHD  \n",
      "I am so very sorry to hear this unbearable news. My prayer for you is that you keep up you strength and that you will be a family very soon. It will happen for you, you have so much love to share.  \n",
      "Wow, have I enjoyed reading this thread! My daughter is multiracial/cultural. Her skin tone is \"tan\" while I am fair and before my hair went gray and started getting it colored it was orginally strawberry blonde. People have said she looks like me or she has my smile.:) I tell them thank you and giggle to myself.  Diane and Deb have GREAT points. We also have to remember that there are more people involved in this process besides us. There are bmom's who have a say in all of this. Before my daughter and I were matched an email was sent to me by my agency about an aa girl. The bmom was not willing to accept me alone but when she found out that my bfriend is aa she gave the ok. She had specifically requested a black couple as parents for the little girl. We did not complete the process because my homestudy was being typed up and finalized before being sent to the agency. In the long run it worked out for the best because a couple who had just returned from an interrupted adoption became this little girl's parents. God is definitely bigger than we are. When my daughter's bmom was shown my profile she chose me right away. I also have an accquaintance that her son's bmom chose her because the two women share a similar physical appearance.  My dd is three and a half years old right now and she is starting to notice a difference in skin color but as stated earlier by someone else she calls Daddy \"brown.\" She doesn't know why but that is what she sees.  By the way Diane, I hope that there is room on your soap box because I'm right there with you on all of your opinions.  It is true, in my case, that a questionairre that is relatively open has less of a wait as opposed to more specific. My home study was completed in February and I was chosen by March. The only reason it wasn't until April was because she wasn't born until then. The fee was also approximately half that of a cc baby.  I'll be checking back in to see further responses since I find this discussion so fascinating.  SHD;)  \n",
      "I agree that there are children who are AA that are in need of families so for me that was my guiding force. I am technically single. I have a boyfriend who is AA but even if he were not in my life I still would feel the way I do. When I received the call about my daughter the agency said she was AA/CC/Na.Am./Asian/Italian/Caribbean so to tell me what shade she was going to be was anybody's guess. Since I had to specific ideas of color it didn't dawn on me to care. I knew I wanted a child and this birthmother chose me. It is a match made in heaven. The community that we live in is becoming more racially mixed so she fits right in with anybody. Good luck in your journey.  \n",
      "I'm still praying for you. I'm in Michigan so I know what you mean about the storm. Maybe this storm was sent so that your birthmom can go her couple of days until your weather clears up and you can get a flight out without delays. I truly don't believe that you are being a fraud. I, like the others, understand where you are coming from. You obviously have a great support group if so many people are anxious for your new arrival. They are just hoping that this situation will work out for you so that you can be happy. I agree with the others that now is the time for you to allow yourself some time for you. Reading is something that you won't be able to do for a long time. Grab a good book and read. It won't be so easy after the little one arrives. After the baby you'll think you'll be able to read but everytime you think you have a chance you find yourself asleep:flowergift: I'll continue to think and pray for you, not only this works out for you but that the stress doesn't get to you. You and DH are all this baby has, take care of yourself so that you can give you child your everything.  SHD  \n",
      "First, I want to congratulate you on being a new Mom. It's a great feeling! My daughter's hair looked just like his when she was born. Her hair also did the same as you described, straight when dry and curly when wet. I felt I needed to wash it as you said about every three days as it started getting oily and musty. I used baby shampoo every couple of days and I also used baby lotion when I bathed her. I'm no expert myself but I think the darker the skin it just shows the \"ash\" quicker. As her hair grew the curls showed up all the time. Now that she's three and a half and her hair is down to the middle of her back it's too long to shampoo and condition. I use strictly a very thick conditioner on her hair about once a week. I have spoken to some women who are AA and they tell me I'm doing the right thing. We have some friends that are AA and the mom washes the girls' hair once a week and rebraids it. What you will probably end up doing is trial and error and then stick with what works best for you. I wish you all the best.  \n",
      "I agree with everyone that there is a Target/Wal-Mart/K-Mart where ever you go so don't bog yourself down with unnecessary cargo. Besides, with all the FAA regulations regarding flying the inspectors lose their minds if you have something you're not suppose to have in your carry-on. I used the hotel portable crib. Thehospital set me up with formula, diapers and blankets. The blankets were not very thick but at least I had something to get me started. I agree with the sling. My daughter did not like it and I wished that she did because believe it or not strangers do feel it is within their right to touch your child especially if he is going to have a full head of hair. One thing that a nurse told me at the hospital that in order for your child to get to know you is to \"kangaroo\" with him. Remove the baby's clothes down to his diaper and your shirt to your undergarments and wrap a blanket around the two of you. He will learn your heartbeat and your smell. I did this with my daughter and you could not convince this child that I did not give birth to her:love: Bring lots of books if you don't get into TV. Do take naps when he does because this is THE most exhausting time in your life. I'm glad I stayed in the hotel for eleven days by myself. (dbfrnd had to work) This was the best bonding time in my life!:flowergift: Our hotel also had a dishwasher so I felt that it sterlized the bottles well enough.  \n",
      "I forgot some other items. I stayed at a hotel that had a kitchenette so since my daughter didn't get released from the hospital until the next day after she was born I shopped for food items for myself also. Pizza gets old after a while. I agree that the store brand of formula is less expensive and has the same ingredients. I used bottled water that I left in the diaper bag so it was room temperature and just mixed it when I needed it. The store brand of diapers worked just as well also at sometimes half the price. I have heard from friends that have boys that sometimes since they tend to pee in the same spot in their diaper it goes through faster, this will be a trial and error experiment. My hotel also had a laundry room and a workout room. While I did laundry I walked on the treadmill. This is one of the few times that you'll be able to take advantage of free time.:flowergift: Congratulations and I'll be thinking of you on Tuesday.  \n",
      "I too would like to recommend the same book, \"Does anyone look like Me?\" Excellent! I would also like to recommend the magazine \"Adoptive Families.\" This month's issue, October 2006, was written just for you!  You are correct about your neighborhood changing. I have lived in my house for eight years and have watched houses bought and sold and noticed the change. Unfortunately these days with schedules the way they are neighbors aren't what they use to be. I am only close to my next door neighbor while everyone else pretty much keeps to themselves. You sound like you have already made this little girl a part of your family so if it works out that you do officially become her parents there are things you will want to consider. Since you live in a small cc town, do you live near any bigger cities that you can travel to give her the experience that she needs? Are you willing to step outside of yourself to let her see that you are the minority? Ex: church, hair salon, museum? Are there possibilities of having friends that are aa? I don't mean walking up to total strangers and asking if they will be friends just because of their skin color. When you seek out different arenas find someone who has similar interests, kids the same age, jobs, movies. Anything. Also hair will be a big thing. There is an abundance of help out there. Perhaps go to a beauty school and have the students help you out with what products to use.  You sound like you will make great parents for this little girl since you have already been asking yourself the tough questions. Love is definitely all you will need but realize that unfortunately there is ignorance out there so get ready for a bunch of silly, intrusive questions and thicken up your skin.  I wish you all the best.:cheer:  \n",
      "This thread has been absoutely fascinating! It certainly has provoked highly emotional opinions. I found myself cheering some on while curious about others. If my child looks up to his or her grandparents and that grp's opinion is one of racism then there would not be many if any visits. I would feel this way even if my child were CC My daughter happens to be multiracial so it's interesting the conversations that occur when people don't know she is multiracial or that my bfriend is black. I've already started cutting off relationships and forging others for my daughter's best interest. It also happens to work out in my best interest since I prefer a variety of people. Lisa, I wish I had your group of friends!:)  The discussion of \"being raised black\" was pretty interesting. I just think it's on the inside. To be aware of where one comes from and the past that comes along with it. Unfortunately not all of the history is good but it must be told. My daughter will have to learn about slavery,internment camps, the mob and reservations. At the same time she will also learn about the positive aspects of these wonderful people that have blended together to make this beautiful child.  I've had occasion to discuss this topic with a friend of mine. He quickly reminded me that noteveryone has my opinion and that if someone is not willing to step outside of themselves then folks of the black race would rather they not adopt a child of color since that child would be missing out on some very vital information about themselves and where they come from.  What I don't understand is that why can't people get in their car and drive to a large city close to them and get the cultural diversity that a child could benefit from? It's not that hard. Not all these rural areas that everyone seems to be from are in the middle of a cornfield. There has got to be someplace you can go to step outside of your lily white town. I realize that not everyone has the fortune of living down the road from Detroit, Atlanta, Chicago, or New York. I'm just curious about your surrounding areas.  I would not advocate a couple adopting an AA child if they couldn't handle it but I just don't understand why a child from China or South America is easier to handle. Please don't compare apples and oranges by saying that you wouldn't be equipped to rear a child with mental/physical challenges and then saying that you can't handle an AA child. Resources for raising an AA child are at arm's length.  The point was also brought up about you neverknow who your child will bring home to meet the folks. Are you saying that your spouse could not/would not bond with a son/daughter-in-law that is black. Would there be a bond with the grandkids or would it depend on what degree of skin tone the child turns out to be? Some AA get darker as they age. My daughter is darker now than when she was born.  One lady pointed out to me that in some photos my daughter looks AA. She also pointed out that when the summer comes she'll get obviously darker. This same lady said this with great pride as she is AA and likes pointing out that my daughter is AA. Another lady I know is Asian(Japanese)/AA. She has taken photos of our children together and sent them to her family members. They all want to know if my daughter is Japanese because she looks like she belongs to their family. My point is that I would be doing my daughter a great disservice if I raised her strictly white and gave her no background knowledge.  Please don't think that AA are exclusionary in recognizing when a person doesn't \"act\" like they think they should. Individuals that do not chose to get to know me think I am \"one of those.\" You know, I'll only date \"black guys\" or nosy CC have even had the nerve to ask me if it's true what the say about black guys. Or if they hear a radio loudly playing R&B they automatically think it's me.  The OP was \"Is it a cop-out?\" My opionion is, yes, but I don't have to walk in your shoes and I don't know what your life is like. I myself think living outside of the box is much more interesting but then again I'm not known for following the norm.  I do wish you all of you the best in whatever road God sends you down. I hope I haven't gone on too much but I've just joined and had to catch up on two months of this particular thread. It took a while since a three year old's patience level is not at the highest. Lots of love to everyoneSHD  \n",
      "My 3 year old DD is multiracial AA/Asian/Na.Am/CC(Italian). All of these races have dark, thick hair. Everyone comments about how gorgeous her hair is but when she hits puberty she'll cry about how she hates it when there are women out there paying big bucks to have hair like her. Seriously, it's thick, curly and very full. I wash it once a week but don't use shampoo. I use a very thick conditioner, Rusk Conditioners calm condition. When she takes a shower I wet her hair first thing, load it up with conditioner, like joskids said, \"can't use too much.\" Then I place a shower cap on her head while she continues her shower, so it stays on for about five or 10 minutes. When she's finished I rinse and brush, put conditioner, Rusk smooth conditioner, and braid or put it in a bun.  Have you tried a local beauty school? The future stylists could help you out with products and styles that are right for you. They might even be able to give you the names of the products they use on themselves or on customers.

      "I'm so glad you posted this topic NickChris. This morning on Good Morning America, [url=http://abcnews.com]Online news, breaking news, feature stories and more - ABC News[/url] I watched as they repeated a study done 60 years ago. It was very heart wrenching to watch. They had two dolls exactly alike with the only difference being their color. At the time of the original test a majority of the kids chose the white doll as being good, attractive and looking like them. GMA did the study with 19 AA/BR children. When they were asked about the attractiveness of the doll a majority of the girls said the white doll while all of the boys said both were pretty. One little girl who was BR said the AA doll was bad and unattractive and when asked which one she looked like she said the AA doll but that she herself is good and attractive.  Tomorrow they are doing a study about catching a taxi in New York. That should be interesting although we can probably guess the outcome of that study.  I completely agree that while we like to think we are beyond any racist bias I think it will not be in my lifetime that it becomes true. I continue to pray for it with all my heart though.  \n",
      "Hi, I hope the best for your journey. I too am a single mom. I absoutely love it! Yes, there are hard days and a LOT of sleepy times. My DD is almost five years old. I don't have a ton of support system family/friends wise but what I do have is great. I work at my DD's daycare after I get of work at my regular job so that helps out with fees and I do a barter system with my neighbor girl for babysitting duties. (I do her acrylic nails)  My job is pretty flexible where I work strictly 7:30 to 3:30. There is overtime but it's optional. I have good benefits like insurance, sick, vacation, and personal time. The few times she's been sick they were more than generous with time off, sometimes even letting me use vacation time instead of exhausting my sick time.  Some of the things to consider are the expenses like daycare, diapers, and formula. We spent 11 days waiting for ICPC to clear and in retrospect those days were a Godsend. We totally bonded!  Being a parent is something that cannot be described until one ventures into it but being a single parent is even more indescribable. My thoughts and prayers are with you in your quest to being a parent.  \n",
      "I echo the others, it's quite a ride but well worth it. Imagine in four or five years when your baby/babies are bigger and out of the blue they come up with something like, \"Mommy, I love you.\" My heart just melts when my DD does this and she always knows when I need it most. Hang in there everyone here is very helpful. My prayers are with you.  \n",

      "I agree with NickChris, depends on my mood. IMO my DD's adoption story is hers and hers alone. The general public does not need to know the details. We don't walk up to complete strangers and ask their conception story so why should they know our story.  Now on the other hand if a complete stranger asks a suggestion might be to ask them why they want to know b/c this individual might be interested in adoption. Here is where being an advocate would be helpful. It's still your choice to answer so that your child's privacy might be respected.  Good luck and welcome to the forums. Helayne  \n",
      "I haven't read through everyone's answers yet but it sounds like the general feeling is yes there's sadness but crazy in love with kiddos so are able to get over it or are working through it. I can honestly say that the only time that I'm really funky about not getting pregnant is when I hear of an individual who is able to get pregnant just by looking at a man. I know of one young woman who leads a lifestyle that really doesn't need to include children. She's been in jail for drunk driving, hangs around some questionable men. She already has two children and recently suffered the loss of a third. Another young woman has four children by three different dads. Her parents have the two older kids and by the way things are going when the two youngest get to be close to school age they too might live with grandma/grandpa.  That being said, I look at my big girl and I know why God made the plans that He did. I recently watched the movie Bella and viewed the director's comments. He said, \"If you want to make God laugh, make a plan.\" It really struck home.  I wouldn't change a thing and if I get those pangs all I have to do is look at her and she says, \"Mom, I love you.\" That's the results I was looking for, not being pregnant.  \n",
      "Hi and all my best to you and you expanding family. To be honest with you if you are flying pack as little as possible. I rented a car because not everything I needed/wanted was within close proxmitiy. There is a Target, Wal-Mart, Kmart, etc. in every town and every state. The hospital will also load you up with most everything you need. I stayed at a hotel that was a suite. It was almost like a little apartment. They also had a \"grocery store\" and free laundry facility all within the grounds of the hotel. I even walked on the treadmill while DD slept in her carseat. This room had a small kitchenette complete with a tiny dishwasher (great for washing bottles) and dishes. I fixed simple things to eat like spaghetti for dinner and grits and eggs for breakfast. We didn't really need to leave but got out a few days for some fresh air and change of environment. I used the small travel crib that the hotel provided. I was comfortable with the cleanliness of everything and the staff was wonderful with how they helped me out.  I'll be thinking about your stay and also remember there are malls you can walk and a library is always close.  \n",
      "Good point. Eagleswing is right, people against adoption are going to look for anything to prove their point. From what I can tell the US foster system is so full caseworkers have a difficult time keeping up. I believe these children are from bio-families.  \n",
      "This happened to a little girl in our community two years ago and the murderer has yet to be found. Many in the area suspect the mom and her boyfriend. Nothing has been proven but there were too many inconsistencies on the mom's part. Nancy Grace tore her apart so she quit doing interviews.  There's a special corner in hell for people who do this to children.  \n",

      "caths1964One day I'd like to see an adoption storyline on a TV show showing all the \"major players\". It either seems to be aparents/child, no bmother to be seen - she is a shadowy individual in the background (if ever mentioned at all) - or it is emother who then has child and her life moves on as if nothing ever happened. I don't watch this show on a regular basis but Brothers and Sisters had an adoption storyline and the Emom/Bmom was very much involved in the story.  \n",

      "oceanicaI just wanted to say that every circumstance is different and I know there is a push for open adoptions everywhere and especially here. I really would like for newbies and those who have closed adoptions to NOT feel like they've done something icky. Closed adoptions are perfectly acceptable options (with some benefits as you say crick) and nobody should feel pressured or put upon by anyone else who is not in their shoes. So very true. No two situations are alike and need to be looked at on an individual basis.  \n",
      "I haven't read all the posts but the ones I went through were excellent. DD's school studies a different moral each month. April is the month of Compassion. :flower: Mrs. D had all the kids make a \"warm fuzzy\" for anyone they chose. DD chose a teacher with whom she has established a repoire. They share the same first name. The kids made a certificate along with their warm fuzzy and read it aloud in front of the other kids during their morning assembly. It was the sweetest thing I have ever seen. There were many tears and it wasn't just the mom's, I saw a dad who had obviously been crying making me lose it all the more.  It must have made the kids think because that evening Big Girl told me Mrs. K had happy tears in her eyes. :love:  \n",

The title to this thread cracked me up because DD's Bmom refers to me as \"baby mama.\" I'm not offended in the least, as a matter of fact I think its kind of funny. ;) She tries to lighten things up with humour so I see nothing wrong with it. Big Daddy will sometimes send me a text in the middle of the day asking how's his baby mama. Like the others its something we do between us.  \n",

      "RiahsI get a lot of comments still because a lot of people think J looks like me but with a lot more curls. His hair is beautiful thick, long, and curly and he is only a year. He has had hair from birth. It attracts a lot of attention. So often people will ask where did he get the curls--it especially confuses them when my dh is along. He shaves his head and so sometimes they write it off and say oh the curls come from your husband. I usually just say thank you and leave it at that.  When J was first born, people used to ask if I had a lot of heartburn during pregnancy (a wive's tale because of all the hair). That one always threw me and so I would usually say oh he is adopted, but I found it would usually lead to more questions or comments that I didn't want to hear. It's like you have now opened the door to anything that crosses their mind about adoption. Like oh you are so wonderful for adopting. That comment usually for some reason really got me because I felt like they were implying that J's birthmom was lesser or something. Anyway so I learned to just say yes, I had heart burn. Figured I did have a lot of heartburn during the wait for him.  Now, I just say thank you. Sometimes they push and ask where the curls come from and I usually just shrug. We had the same thing. DD was born with a headfull of dark hair. Her hair brought in a lot of attention and questions. As a matter of fact Bmom did have heartburn. (I always wondered about the heartburn theory)  I agree with the others, share when you feel it's okay and generally people are being nice with their compliments. To me the thing is when you open your life to strangers, even just a little info, they feel you are opening up to them and they will try to get even more.  Good luck, I missed your little bug's pic but I'm sure she's a sweetie. Congrats!  \n",

      "When I made the difficult choice to put DD on meds for her ADD/ADHD a friend of mine said, \"Whoa, hold on a minute, did you try anything else and are you sure she needs it? Did you think about the side effects?\" Seriously?! I've only been living with this kiddo for eight years and we've tried just about everything but no, I have no clue what I'm doing and neither do the docotors or her teacher. We all decided to put her on the highest doasage of meds and zone her out so we won't have to \"deal\" with her behavior. :grr:  This friend just recently asked me how it was going and I told him her school does testing three times a year and in December she tested above grade level on all subjects and is doing \"Super Challenge\" work. Her behavior in the class is much better (not that she was bad, just couldn't sit still in her seat) she's paying attention and completing her work. But yeah, I don't have a CLUE of what I'm doing. :rolleyes:  \n",

      "BabyRachelVAThat I'm too stern with my kiddos, that they don't feel loved enough I'm scared to death that my kids will be afraid to talk to me about whats going on in their lives because they'll be afraid of how I react....  which ties into my other fear, that they'll turn out like me as a teen :( I rebelled because I was over protected, i'm not a helocopter parent but I do expect respect and manners... I'm just so scared that they will hide their problems away... I think you and I might be sisters! ;) I could have written exactly what you have listed. It's a good thing Big Daddy has older kids so he's BTDT and knows what he's done wrong. He can have a conversation with Big Girl and get stuff out of her I could never drag out. Guess it's a learning process and I just hope I don't screw things up along the way. :rolleyes:  Some of my other fears are the same as PPs. If she were to die I don't know what I would do. If I died I know she would be in good hands with Big Daddy but I would really hate missing out on her life. Another fear is getting into an abusive relationship or even a relationship that isn't abusive but the guy is a real knucklehead. Substance abuse, I too have witnessed the downward spiral of that ugly scene and never want to go through it again. I fear she'll reject me as a parent. I fear I won't be able to help her pay for college. This leads to my next fear and that is she won't go to college. Also some of the others, abduction, accident, etc. Now off to hug my Big Girl and live in the moment. :hippie:  \n",
      "I agree with the others, very silly advice. I agree with the Pedia-sure and whole milk but chips and ice cream? Seriously?!  Big Girl is a tiny little one too BUT her Bparents are not very tall and are natually slim so it stands to reason. Genetics are a very big factor so what do Josh's bparents look like? I make a protein shake loaded with all kinds of goodies. Strawberries, bananas, blueberries, oatmeal, peanut or almond butter, and protein powder. Chicken and peanut butter are also great sources of protein. Stick with the healthy stuff and sparingly enjoy the snacks.  \n",

      "acleeI'm of the opinion where I'll read anything I can get my hands on, and then draw my parenting line somewhere down the middle.  This is on my book shelf, but all the books about race are in front of it right now. I feel like the only thing my kids wish I knew right now is how to give them more than 2 M&M's at a time. I think as they move more toward elementary years and older this stuff becomes more relevant. Right now adoption isn't a huge part of my life. We're just barely getting Ty to process he's different than me. He likes to point to my little clump of freckles and say, \"Like Tywer!\" So if you are adopting an older child, it might be worth reading as long you don't take everything as \"100% fact\". All this stuff is just one persons opinion...you know? Alcee is right. I read it after Big Girl was born and it totally freaked me out. There were other books I should have put ahead of that one. There are plenty of adoption books out there so you just need to figure out which one applies to your particular family.  \n",

      "It's funny you should post this. I haven't read the article but now that DD is almost 8yo I'm really starting to see some of me in her. Meaning she has picked up on my mannerisms.  We were outside one very cold afternoon and we're trying to rush to our vehicle and grumbling the whole way. I hear her say, \"Mercy!\" I cracked up inside because that is totally something I would say. What makes it even funnier is I got it from my mom. Just yesterday she was telling Daddy about swim class and how some of the kids were aggrivating her during free time so she got out and got dressed. He's dying laughing and whispering to me, she sounds just like you!  We try to do our praising to her by making it sound like it's her idea to improve herself. I.E. you know Big Girl you're doing so well in II swim class and I bet as soon as you dive off the block you'll probably move up to III. The reason we feel that works for her is because she'll make predictions about what she's going to do. She's a determined little girl and when she sets her mind on something she usually accomplishes it.  \n",

We were gone for 11 days with ICPC so we had the entier time to ourselves. I loved it! :cloud9: DD didn't care for any of the wraps so I carried her a lot. Like Fe, we are very bonded.

This is just *MY* opinion but...*I* control the purse strings in my house and *I'M* the one who decides when we go to McD's.

My kids played the whole vacation when they first got theirs (2 years ago) and then they grew tired of it. They've played it here and there, and just recently picked it up thanks to ScribbleNauts and Sonic Colors. I fully expect it to go away once school starts again (they took it to our cabin this week, but are tempting fate because they left the chargers at home). :arrow: Whoa! You are tempting fate. Good luck with that. ;)  Two nights ago we all piled in bed to watch TV (that's right, Mommy, Daddy and Big Girl-that was one filled up bed) and she said something about her hand tingling. Whoops! Part of me says, you spent a crap load of money on it so she should play it but the other part of me says, we need to get out of the house and stay off the computer/DS.  You're right about her time will be limited once school starts because her schedule is pretty full. Maybe it will help at the swim meets, it'll give her something to do in between her turn to swim.  \n",

      "I saw this episode too and when I saw the post here I checked into it more. The reason the aunt told her it was for good was because she originally told them she wanted to place the baby with them and when the aunt/uncle brought the baby home she changed her mind then parented for a month. The aunt didn't want the baby to keep going back and forth so it was her way of saying it wasn't fair to the baby to keep switching parents. I read her blog and while she is in pain every day and goes through her bouts of depression it sounds *to me* as if she feels what she did is what is right for the baby. As far as the aunt/mom not smiling while the camera was in her face during a diaper change, I can't say I would be thrilled either. While I had perma-grim when DD was born there were times when that grin was strained due to lack of sleep, no shower and not eating right. We don't know what this woman had going on that day so I think judging this her because she wasn't smiling at that particular moment is a bit rough. Remember it was pointed out earlier editing is everything, we have no clue what happened before/during/after this take.  She gets to see her regurally from what I read. It doesn't sound like she's getting therapy which might help her with her depression. I pray she seeks out some therapy. She said she slept half the day away on Christmas then regretted it later because she wasted time by not seeing the baby.  She does seem like a sweet girl and on her blog she has lots of pictures of her friends and different things they've been up to. It looks like she's got a good group around her so hopefully the can help hold her up when things are rough.  \n",

Personally I don't have a good relationship with my family so I'm not trying to be close but it sounds like you are so go with your gut.

I have to admit having lived in Florida as a child (I was born there) and living in the frosty north now I would run down to sunny FLA in a minute.

      "Great thread! These are truths that need to be heard. Unfortunately there is still a lot of misinformation out there.  Adoption has changed from what it use to be. The agency we worked with only allows open or semi-open adoptions. They want to make sure a first mom is comfortable knowing she will see her child as he/she grows. There are many legal contracts signed to insure whatever contact agreed upon continues. According to this paperwork there are legal ramafications if it is not followed. But then again, sharing dd's milestones with first mom is natural to us. Who wouldn't want to brag about a great kid like dd so I'm sure she does the same when she recieves her updates.  First mom has parented before so she knows what it's like. It's not pink ribbons and cutsey all the time. She made a well informed choice based on her own experience. She has shared her thoughts with dd in letter form before dd was born so when talking about her adoption story we have first hand from first mom how she came to such a difficult choice.  First mom is a very intelligent individual. Not \"out there\" no drug exposure pre-natal. We were a matched before birth because while she knew it was a difficult choice she wanted to make sure a plan was in place. She had even wanted me in the delivery room but it wasn't possible. In retrospect we have our whole lives to spend with dd so I'm glad she was able to share that special time with her alone and have that memory belong just to her. Nobody in the triad is perfect. That's because we're all human. She has thoughts and feelings as do dd, dh and myself. We all handle situations differently. When dd asks questions throughout our journey I will remind her as such.  There may be a time when first mom wants to take some time off. That's her choice. She will be back. We will be here when she's ready. Once again, we're human and we handle things differently at different times. Something may come up where her grief is triggered and she needs time to work through it.  One thing I don't have answers for dd and that is first dad. He's allowed to be human too and unfortunately his choice is to distance himself. I'm sorry he has made this choice because dd is an amazing individual. I'm sure she has some of his talents and he'll not know about them. Maybe one day he'll want to know dd, I hope he comes around.  We are a family first no matter how we got there. No family is alike ours just happens to be formed through adoption.  \n",
      "Say it with me...HOT MESS!!!  \n",
      "I just had a thought, when a woman who placed a child for adoption passes is that written in the obit? Does it read, survived by her children John, Jane and Bobby who was placed for adoption at birth. That would be just as awkward.  As far as celebrities I remember Roseanne Barr placed a daughter and they reunited years later. I know she's not in the forefront much anymore but when she's pictured with her kids do they mention the daughter?  \n",
      "I echo the others with addressing his teachers and tutoring for school adjustments. Sounds like a bright boy who is eager to learn its just a matter of finding HIS path. My DD is a very petite not yet 50lb girl but there are times she eats so much I question where she puts it. As my mom would say, she's got hollow legs. ;) when she goes through her spurts I fill up a small RubberMaid spill proof container with crunchy peanut butter and she just eats it with a spoon. Almonds and/or almond butter is great protein too but can be a little pricey. Working off the whey protein powder idea I make a \"meal\" with it and you could have this be his breakfast. Seriously it tastes way better than what I'm about to describe. A whole banana, strawberries, blueberries, almonds or peanutbutter, protein powder then a huge handful of spinach. Add water and ice to help mix it and make it shake-like. I'm not sure how long this will hold over a growing 16yo boy but DH says it fills him for a while and he's a pretty big guy. All my best to you.  \n",
      "I can't speak on what people are calling an over diagnosis but in our home it is very real. Kindy wasn't bad but the teacher was great at keeping the kids moving in the half day she had with them.  First grade was a disaster. Big Girl had three separate indicents her teacher did not witness firsthand and labeled her a bully. She was so outdone with DD she didn't even try, so sad, her loss. DD would totally zone out and much of her work was incomplete. She allowed her to bring it home to be completed. I'm assuming so she wouldn't have to deal with her. By the end of the year the teacher just let her slide on through. Kind of a scary thought, wonder how much of this has happened. Glad it was just first grade. Second grade picked up right where first grade left off. She sat in her seat staring off in space. Work left incomplete with no explaination as to what she was doing and why she didn't complete it. I was at the end of my rope. Fortunately her teacher is on top of things and called us in two weeks after school started to work on a plan of action to get DD interested and not just sitting there. She put her on an \"island.\" (DD's desk by hers, facing her) She gave her a task board with the work that was to be completed by the end of the day, popsicle sticks that she moved from the left to the right once done. She gave her a journal. It all worked for a little bit then went by the wayside. This whole time she never once suggested ADD. She's been a teacher at this school since it opened and very well respected. I stopped by the school one day to pick some stuff up and stopped by to chat with her teacher. I'm the one who asked her about it. That's when she told me she thought it was ADD. *SHEW* Somebody finally said out loud what I had been thinking since she was three or four years old.  That was three weeks ago. I cannot believe the change in my Big Girl. She still has her sparkling personality, her wonderful imigination and she's starting to show extreme confidence. Math was always difficult for her but now it's starting to make sense. She's reading at a third grade level and now that she is able to focus there's no telling where she'll go from here. Crick, she completed Little House in the Big Woods. She loved it.  I'm so sad there is such a stigma attached to ADHD/ADD. Right away it's assumed the parent and teacher have given up and want to medicate the child into zombie land so their behaviors don't have to be delt with. Really? I want what's best for my daughter and if helping her focus and excel means she takes meds in order to help her do that then so be it.  Like a pp stated DD's physician stressed she take her meds weekends and holidays. Going off and on is too much for the child and Monday morning is like starting on day one all over again. Besides, she still needs to live her everyday life and her ADD is very hard at home as well as at school. She accomplishes what she sets out to do without wandering off into oblivion. She brushes her own hair now, I can drop her off for swim class while I park the car and I'm confident she's got her swim cap and goggles on ready for class. She's actually doing what I knew she was always capable of doing.  I realize it's not a miracle drug, afterall, she's still 7. She's going to act and do things that are age appropriate but in the meantime we are both (not discounting Daddy here) much happier and life is less stressful. :flower:  \n",
      "jcmSHD, you are so right, it's STIGMA that's attached to ADD/ADHD. Just like mental illness, it's stigmatized to the point that some people want to pretend it doesn't exist and others want to explain it away. I have Diabetes, I take meds for it. I see no difference in how I treat my ADHD. Diseases and disorders of the brain should not be demonized or stigmatized. :o OMG! Diabetes is the exact example I use to compare using meds for when the body has no control over something. When I discussed this with friends I knew would not judge or make asssumptions I said, if your child had diabetes wouldn't you take that child to the doctor and get prescribed meds? Of course, so why is this any different?  DD is able to hyper focus on things she likes while things of no interest are an extreme struggle. So much so she would just not do what she didn't like. You know that's not going to fly in school. What cracks me up is one individual asked if I got a second opinion. Um, hello! I've been living with this child 24/7 the past 7 1/2 years, I think I know her well enough to say she needs help. Her teacher has been teaching long enough she has seen her share of kids to know the difference between ADD/ADHD and bad behavior. Like the others, when she had a good day and her true brilliance shined through we could see what she is capable of. So yeah, I got all the opinions I need. Also like the others, we didn't just walk into the doctor's office and they handed them out like tic tacs. *SHEESH!*  I do realize it's not a miracle drug but it's made a difference in our lives. Tonight is a good example of that. She was over tired and not able to focus very well. I had to stay on top of her and get her to bed. She's also got a lot to be excited about right now so that adds to it. A musical at school tonight, Thanksgiving so days out of school then end of the season swim party for her swim club.  In the past because of all these exciting things she couldn't focus on what day is what. She couldn't tell me if today is Wednesday or Saturday even while looking at a calender.  One of the things for me that was an \"Ah-ha\" moment was she did her math homework before I picked her up from after school care. I double checked it to make sure it was all done and correct. One of the problems asked for her to circle all the addition problems that equalled 100. Before meds she couldn't tell you if 8+2=10, 2+8=10, 6+4=10 and 4+6=10. She had to use her fingers to count each and every problem. Now she's to the point she can look at a problem and tell if it equals 100. She told me all she did was look at the first numbers 80+20=100 so on and so forth. This is HUGE! :happydance:  This will be a life long undertaking, one we'll have to be hypervigilant about. If this helps her succeed and become the wonderful person she is meant to be then I'm up for it.  \n",
      "jcmSHD...it's awesome to hear how well your girl is doing. :) Pretty much everything you wrote about your 7 year old I have experienced. Sometimes it makes me a little sad knowing that so much of my life was spent being frustrated that I couldn't just buckle down and live up to my potential. My parents were called in every semester with those same things being said over and over. So I always felt that I was just a behavior problem and that I was CHOOSING not to do well. I think the judgment that a lot of people have for ADD/ADHD is that they think it's simply behavioral. Sure, a lot of symptoms manifest as behavioral problems, ie. self control. A lot of the attitudes are just plain ignorance, which i do NOT mean in a negative, judgmental way. It's a societal problem across the board. We've just been programmed to think that everything is governed by self control, and it's just not true. :( Thanks JCM, the behavorial issues go along with the self-esteem issues. We disciplined DD but it seemed like she didn't care. In actuality she didn't understand. She couldn't put it together. What she did know was she was \"making poor choices\" and she was getting in trouble. Hopefully this will all change and we can grow and learn from here.  \n",

As for Bishop Long, all I can think of is Michael Baisden's prescient \"Pimps in the Pulpit\" series on his radio show HAHA! Too funny!!! They've been talking about that a lot the past two days. The Bishop was suppose to speak to Roland Martin this morning but his lawyer advised him against it and read a written statement. This is going to be interesting. It'll all come out in the wash.

      "Karen, I didn't want to take away from your thread but I don't want to jinx myself either. :prop:  Big Girl has struck teacher GOLD!!! :clap: As the school year approached I had much angst. Last year was such a disaster I was so worried what this year would bring. Last year Mrs. 1st grade was totally NOT the one for DD. Her style of teaching was \"inside the box.\" She NEVER wanted to venture outside the box and DD NEVER wanted to get inside the box. Mrs. 1st grade never bothered to get to know DD, she proclaimed her a bully after three separate incidents of which she wasn't present nor had the full story. After that she got frustrated with her and kind of just let her float through the year. We tried to work with her but she just wouldn't budge, it was her way or no way. We finally brought in the director of teachers for that wing of the building. All of a sudden we got action. So wish we had done that earlier. Fast forward to this year and DD starts off the way she ended, attention waining, not completing her work, talking, etc...I got an email two weeks in stating we need to discuss DD and get a plan of action. What??? :confused: We're only two weeks into the school year and we need to have a conference already? YIKES!!! We go into speak to Mrs. 2nd grade and turns out she's WONDERFUL!!! :love: She realizes DD is a visual learner and needs to see her accomplishments so she's come up with a task chart so to speak. She's labeled popsicle sticks and velcroed them to a board, as she completes a task she gets to move them from the left side to the right side. Today was Day 1 and she felt more like she \"owned\" her day and could actually see what her day was like. She also said she feels DD is a good hearted person and is always willing to help other students. Almost too much, jumping up to pick something up another child has dropped.  As we complete the meeting she ends by asking about DD's adoption. Turns out, she and her husband are looking into adoption and she had some questions. I KNEW things happen for a reason! :flower:  \n",
      "Thanks Sbaglio. I had heard this teacher was great by other parents so I requested her and boy am I glad I did. DD had trouble with math so I was so hoping she wouldn't fall into that \"girls are no good in math\" stereotype. She's already taken her MAP test and she's right at grade level. Little stinker was starting to understand it but the drama created by her saying she didn't get it also got her out of it. The aforementioned drama worked my nerves.  I'm also proud to say her reading is at a 3rd grade level. YAY!!! :happydance:  \n",
      "Thanks everyone. Day 2 went well also. I sooo hope I'm not jumping the gun by getting excited too early. We're going to do the same thing for chores at home. Mrs. 2nd grade suggested we use magnets on the fridge, put them on the left side then move to the right when completed. This way she can see what she's done and what she has yet to complete.

      "When DD was in a carseat I always tried to park next to the cart corral so I could make the transfer and then just push the cart into the stall. I always felt bad for the person who had to bring the carts inside so I tried to do my little bit to make their job a little easier. As far as the dog at an event I find that a pet peeve of mine as well. Besides the sniffing and pooping I've had owners say to my child (not me, the MOM) go ahead and pet him/her, its very gentle. Uuuum, excuse me, *I* give my child permission to do anything, not you. AND (to me this is a big AND) *YOUR* pet might be gentle *TO YOU* but (I realize some people feel like fur babies are just like their babies so I'm not trying to offend) your pet is still an animal therefore subject to revert back to animal behavior and accidently nip my child. I want my child to understand an animal doesn't know who she is so *IF* she pets it she must approach it slowly and let it smell her then *MAYBE* she can pet it. Animals in a large gathering of people have TONS of smells going on and they are trying to take it all in and if my child just puts her hand out and starts petting the animal that animal just may react to what it knows. Okay, didn't mean to jump on a soapbox and be so preachy, I get frustrated when I see pets at large group gatherings and nobody thinks it could turn ugly in a flash.  \n",
      "Great stories! DDW, that is wonderful news!  DD is 7 1/2 so her moments aren't as jump out at you these days.  Before she was born I purchased a CD titled \"Songs Without Words\" it's all piano music. A couple of years ago she had no interest in the CD, she said she didn't care for the fact she couldn't sing along with it. I was okay with that sinply because I didn't think it would appeal to a 5yo anyway. I keep it in the vehicle for those days when I'm by myself and want to hear some soothing music. :hippie: Two days ago she found the CD and put it in, it had been a while since she listened to it. Today she's listened to it three times! This may not sound like much but I love, love love the piano. :love: We love music in this house, she's constantly singing. I would love for her to take piano lessons one day but don't want to get started too soon, today gives me hope she may ask for lessons on her own without my suggesting it. :rockband:  \n",
      "We've always used proper terms for our body parts in our home. I've also been pretty open with DD being able to see me \"au natural\" so she has an idea of what she'll look like as she matures.  Recently we had a discussion about surgery for our boy cat, Dewey. She asked what kind of surgery he would need. I told her he had to have his testicles removed. She asked where and what that was. I described to her so she could understand. I also said they kind of look like a couple of balls. She straightened up, Oh, I've heard of those. I tried to remain calm because if she saw this is what I looked like inside my head...:eek: she would shut down and not say anything more. She would think she was in trouble.  She told me a boy at daycamp used pipe cleaners and made them into circles. He said what he was calling them, she was confused and asked what he was talking about. He placed them on his shorts by (her words) his private area and told her what he was talking about. Geez, Oh, Pete's. I don't know when all this occured and daycamp is over for the summer. I do know if I told the camp advisor she would immediately take care of it.  What I need to do on my end is introduce her, age appropriately, to sex ed. Does anyone have any suggestions of books I can use to educate her? I think this thread has been started in the past but I didn't know how far I would have to go back to find it. Any and all help would be appreciated.  \n",
      "LOL Amy! I guess when it's time to explain birds and the bees to Ty he's going to want to know in detail the whole story. :rolleyes:  Mom, I have been explaining but I guess I never thought I would have to explain the boy part just yet, I mean in detail that is.  \n",
      "Thanks for the suggestions.  Crick, I think part of it is she doesn't have a brother as a frame of reference so it's all a mystery to her. :rolleyes:  Quantum, I think being able to express her feelings will help in further discussions too. Mom, I forgot to say something about the over-explaining to a 3rd grader. Yeah, that's a bit much. With my DD's over-active imagination I can only imagine where her mind would go. :woohoo: I want DD to know the truth too but I agree with you, time and place.  \n",
      "crickNo flu shots for us, but none of us have low immune systems or health issues. If we did, I would get the shot for everyone. I agree. We're pretty healthy.

I haven't heard of any shortages this year so that's good.  \n",
      "I understand why you feel this way.  A few years ago at DD's daycare we got involved with a SIDS group. One mom, S, who got us all involved lost a baby, so we all supported a walk. Well, S was close friends with our state senator, R (they went to the same church) and when we were at the walk the news station interviewed senator R. He introduced S and called her his \"adopted\" daughter right on camera. I became furious instantly. :mad: I let this go, it took me a while, but away it went. After the walk we decided to start a walk in our small town. At our meetings he introduced her to everyone as his \"adopted\" daughter. I became irked all over again. The next time I saw S at daycare I (silly me) thought I could talk to her and explain how insensitive these statements were. Not knowing how immature she was it blew up and I ended up crying and yelling at her and she too yelled back at me. (not like a screaming match just raised voices) When she left she immediately called senator R. He called the daycare a few days later and I heard the director say my last name into the phone. Come to find out the good senator was calling to talk to me. He had the nerve to tell me he \"heard\" I was talking about him. Umm, hello? Aren't you use to people talking about you? You're in politics, it's part of the game. Fortunately I had my wits about me this time and told him, well, I can't validate any conversation until all parties are brought together and we have a civil adult conversation. Oh, no! He didn't want to do that. Well, I told him this conversation was over because I don't have one-way conversations based on he said, she said.  The walk didn't last much longer, maybe one or two more. S and senator R are no longer friends, shows how \"adopted\" she was.  I hope the lesson I walk away with after all that drama is, find out what the relationship is before I allow myself to get so emotionally involved. Maybe it's harmless.  I do have to admit I do agree with Alcee, adopting a pet, really? :arrow:  \n",

DD looks like Mowgli she's so skinny. She's healthy (only 1 ear infection EVER) sleeps well, has a healthy appetite and her only medical issue is seasonal allergies.  We don't discuss weight in this household. Too much emphasis is placed on size, some people are just meant to be thicker but still healthy. Oak, it's funny you should mention same aged children being such different sizes. I brought DD to work one day and she's fond of one of my co-workers, she ran to him and he picked her up with great ease. He has grandchildren her age who are quite a bit thicker than her. He gave me a hard time that I wasn't feeding her enough and he almost threw her up to the ceiling.  \n",

My DH and his two sisters sometimes call their mom by her first name, and have since they were young (she was a single mom, and they are all very close). My sister and I could never DREAM of calling our parents by their first names. So acceptability varies, I guess. I'm with Sbaglio on this. My sibs and I NEVER would have had the slightest inclination to call our parents by their names. When DD was your child's age we called each other \"Mommy\" \"Daddy\" as if they were our names. Like a PP stated they mimic what they hear. Don't get me wrong, she did try a few times to slip our given names in but we quickly corrected that.  \n",

We know these things because we collect data. If we don’t collect data, then we have to rely on anecdotes. We have a black man in our highest elected office, and most of us can tell a story of a white person who died in a drowning accident. But statistics prove that we do not live in a color-blind society. And until the statistics prove that we do, I feel that we are obligated to take part in the studies that paint portraits of what our society is really like, even if we don’t like the content.

      "I'm so sorry for everyone involved. This is very disturbing and sad.  Our little town had a similar situation happen last year. A 5yo girl was kidnapped and ended with the same results as the situation in your community. It's the most sickening feeling so I know exactly how you feel.  Prayers for everyone and a swift capture and conviction for the lost soul who was so uncaring and unfeeling as to take an innocent life.  \n",
      "DD turned 7 a few months ago and most of her crying jags are out of frustration. When she's being disciplined or if she doesn't understand her math work.  She has deep feelings but can keep them in check waaaay better than I do. Example: if we watch a movie with a sad ending or see something that has an emotional story line I'm bawling my eyes out and she's the one to comfort me.  \n",
      "I don't have any suggestions but I think it's great DH is so open and putting his emotions out there. I work with all men so I understand how rare this outpouring is.  Good luck and I hope it all works out for you.  \n",
      "Thanks for posting this TX, very thought provoking.  \n",
      "loveajaxFadzi, that's hilarious!! And I usually get mistaken for grandma...booooo!!!! haha Karen, I get the same response from people. :mad:  Fadzi, good for you. Kids are so honest, aren't they? ;)  It's funny you should start this thread. This weekend we were at the beach. There were many families there, mostly CC but a few families of color were sprinkled in. I saw a family (I'll call them a family due to the fact they were all together on one blanket) all the adults were CC but the baby was AA. I was obviously staring and when they looked my direction I gave them a huge smile. In the past I have approached people I knew were adoptive families but I am such an emotional person I always lose it. On a daily basis DD and I go through life uneventful but occasionally I get deep inside my own thoughts and realize how fortunate I am to have DD in my life. Soooo, when I try to start a conversation it takes me back to the adoption journey emotionally and the person I am trying to talk to thinks I'm a crazy nut. As a result I don't say anything but then again I also want to respect other folks privacy.  \n",
      "aclee The only thing that is wicked annoying is when I get asked and they say, Oh I would love to adopt a cute little black baby...or something stupid like that...that's annoying. You would not BELIEVE how many people wanted to adopt a baby after Big Girl was born and we became a family. Yep, I put in a special order for a tan colored, spunky attitude, beautiful little girl. UGH!!!! :arrow:  \n",
      "This past weekend we went to the beach on Saturday/Sunday and on Monday at the mall and movie theater. Yesterday I had to work but thank the good Lord my truck had air. DD went to camp but they kept the kids inside all day. Today I took a vacation day and only left the house for one thing. Softball was cancelled for tonight but wasn't planning on going anyway. Sitting in a pool of my own sweat for 1 1/2hrs didn't sound like my kind of fun anyway.  I cleaned out the filters and that has helped the air conditioner not work so blasted hard. I was almost cold last night.  Through all this Big Girl has a cold! How the heck does that happen? She slept awful last night so I've given her some meds and will get a better night's rest tonight. As far as dinner, leftovers heated in the microwave.  \n",
      "Stormster, I say heated but it was a pizza for 30 seconds. Not really \"heated\" just melted the cheese a bit. ;)  I do crack myself up. I was born in Florida and lived in Alabama and Kansas for years so it's not like this is my first go around with heat. Once you're away from that kind of heat for a while this feels oppressive. I remember a radio station in Kansas would have a contest every year as to when the bank thermometer would ready 100deg the FIRST time. As in, we know it's going to get there several times throughout the summer but we want to know when the first time will be. DD is feeling better and will go to camp tomorrow but more than likely will not go outside again. I'm okay with that.  \n",
      "Too cute! I agree with the others, next time take a pic.  I understand about the remote. I say for men it's an extension of...well you know what I mean. They're very protective of the remote. ;) BTW, it's been hotter than bejesus here too. Miserable!  \n",
      "RebeccaInOR I had an old car parked in the driveway for longer than I want to admit. I let the kids play it all the time. They spent many hours \"driving\" to imaginary locations. When the floor started rusting I realized it was time to get rid of the old boat. My kids still fondly recall those days.:drive:  This reminds me of the opening scene of Chitty Bang Bang. :p  I'm pretty strict with the language, my mom had a mouth like a sailor (ironically she was in the Navy way back when) and there's just something about it I can't pass on to my daughter.  Bedtimes are for the most part strict. She wakes when the room becomes light and when she gets up she hits the ground running. Makes for a looooong day when she can't think clearly. Very frustrating.  The things I would be looked upon as being a \"bad parent\" are as follows...  She barely ate baby food. The veggies were ok but the meat was awful. It smelled bad and she cried the whole way through. As a result she ate what we ate.  Daddy works a swing shift and spends a lot of time with his older kids so more times than not she's in bed with me.  We eat breakfast together in the morning but if we have a movie we're in the living room for dinner. Lately since it's been summer we're on the front porch eating dinner and watching a movie. To me it's the time spent together as opposed to where it's spent.  Saturday and Sunday are reserved for cinnamon rolls, hard and fast rule.  Sometimes we eat in my bed but no chips, they're just too difficult to keep from getting in the bed.  Oddly some of you mentioned allowing your children to venture off by themselves. Just this weekend we went to a metropark beach. As we were getting out of the car and unpacking she had a huge urge to use the bathroom. The restroom area was close enough for her to run to so I let her go by herself, finished the getting the few things out of the car then headed to the bathroom. She was fine and didn't have an accident. It's all good.  Friday night is a free for all. No bath and more than likely pizza or a pre-cooked meal of some sort. It's the end of the week and I'm tired so just don't feel like being Betty Crocker.  Holiday weekends all bets are off. Unhealthy foods are the rule instead of the exception. BlockBuster movie deal of three movies, two pops, two theater candies and one bag of popcorn. :popcorn:  I let her watch Survivor, Big Brother and Amazing Race. The language is beeped out and I turn it off when they show \"adult situations.\" Lately we've been watching America's Got Talent.  She's taken baths by herself since she was 4 and this year started taking showers and washing her own hair.  She packs her own lunch and gets her backpack ready for day camp every night. I don't help her decide what she wants to eat. She knows what's available so she chooses from that.  She cleans out the cat's litterbox. I had my pets, she asked for this guy so it's her responsibility.  I don't know if this makes me a bad parent or raising a responsible independent kid. I guess time will tell. I'm pretty anal and strict but I know when to let some rules slide.  \n",

      "Such cute pictures. Pez, I love that outfit! Brooklyn, it was 90deg here too. We went to the beach. Arkansas, love the tattoo. ;)  Here's my Big Girl. Not a holiday dress but sparklers and being festive. We do sparklers evey year. This holiday we didn't go to an organized fireworks but our neighbors do it up so nice there's no need to fight the crowds.  [ATTACH]84988[/ATTACH]  \n",

      "usisarahI can't believe it (actually I can...I believe through God all things are possible) but my mom is completely awake and TALKING and even ate some food today. Her doctors are totally baffled. She'll need a new pace maker witha defibulator (probably spelled wrong) and they're talking about doing that surgery next week! One of her nurses walked in who hadn't seen her in a few days and was wondering what the heck was going on because my mom was doing so many activities. Thanks so much for all the thoughts and prayers :) With prayer all things are possible and God answers those prayers. I'm so happy she's doing better. :clap:  \n",

Happy Birthday to us firecrackers! :cake:  TGM, good luck with gma, you'll do fine. Love, TGM and JCM sorry about your about your losses, it's never easy. It's good to hear you have such fond memories. Crick, please keep a bucket of water close by and stand back!  \n",
      "I can't believe I didn't think of this before today but so happy the lightbulb came on. Our state park is a nice bike ride from our house but the lake is nasty. When we went over the Memorial Day weekend Big Girl jumped in the water and ran out telling me, Mommy, it's nasty! BUUUUT today it occured we could drive an hour or so by car and go to the OTHER side of the lake. It's suppose to be in the high 80's/90's this weekend so water sounds nice. I'm thinking we'll go to the beach Saturday and Sunday then to the movies :popcorn: on Monday as a way to end the long weekend and ease into the new week. Of course we'll do sparklers...safely. Thanks for the reminder Raven. ;)  \n",
      "My schedule is the opposite as yours Ocean. If I worked out that late at night I'd never get to sleep. I work out very early in the morning. I have the same equipment as you, I have a bike, treadmill and step box. My problem is motivation. I get in a groove in the summer but once it gets cold out I can't seem to drag myself out my nice toasty warm bed. I do have some vidoes from The Firm. They're actually pretty good but I feel like a clutz doing them. If I did them on a regular basis I would get my coordination back. Good luck with your workout.  \n",
      "Ocean she's beautiful! I'm with Port, you're in trouble when she's gets older. ;)  \n",
      "I am so sorry for your loss. Its never easy. Your DD seems to be handling it well and working through the grieving process. I'm crying with you as I'm reminded of the loss of my last two pets so I understand your pain. God bless.  \n",
      "That's so good to hear. Glad he's responding well. Hope the next dr.'s goes as you expect. I don't know anything about dreams but I can understand your feelings about it being cruel/happy. God bless.  \n",
      "DD has experienced the same thing. I would rub her legs and tease her at the same time about growing. I would tell her she's not my baby anymore and I would be sad. This minimized the drama like Questia is referring to and settles Big Girl down to go to sleep. DD is going through a spurt right now. No weight gain but getting taller. She almost looks like Mowlgi from Jungle Book. LOL!  \n",
      "I would have done the same. Taken the baby then go around the corner to keep an eye on them, used my cell phone and called the police. Its so sad people lose themselves to outside influences. Hopefully they get some help and get their life on track and this baby finds a home.  \n",
      "When DD was in daycare they went by a \"feels like\" temp. I don't if it was a state mandate or something they themselves did. If it went above that temperature they played in the basement. The kids were able to run and play so they didn't feel cooped up. At times they would run and play in the sprinkler so they were able to go out also. Sounds like you've got someone who's pretty good with the kids, that's very fortunate. Stay cool everyone. :)  \n",
      "YAY! I plan on surprising Big Girl and take her today. We have a coupon for the popcorn so hopefully I won't overdo it. :)  \n",
      "LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it!<3 I thought it was very well done. Like a PP stated, don't know who enjoyed it more, me or Big Girl. :) I have to add the marketing machine Disney is will conveniently put the dvd out at Christmas time. I've already told Big Girl to put it on her list. ;)  \n",
      "Our agency set up our schedule. The first five years it was twice a year then once a year until 18. After the fifth year Bmom asked if we could continue twice a year. Big Girl's sib has a birthday in August so I send pics then and at Christmas I'll send pics along with our card.  \n",
      "I just have to tell you the conversation with your teenaged son was amazing! Boys don't generally open up easily or spill their emotions so this must have been on his mind for quite some time. Very sweet, his concern for his younger sib. Good job on both of you and your son's part. Keep up the good work!  \n",
      "I have to say I'm with Raven on this one. His comment was totally inappropriate to the 60yo patient. It doesn't matter if he was trying to be funny or lighten the mood, bottom line is she felt uncomfortable and that's what matters. I'd speak to him about that. The cussing, well, that sounds like his personality. Very unprofessional IMO but sometimes a leopard is not going to change his spots. My co-workers are very bad about this. They use cuss words for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. They don't even realize they're doing it. One time I asked J if he kissed his wife with that mouth. I agree with PP that if you are happy with his work then continue and forewarn folks what they're stepping into. Mostly I would address the comment your patient discussed with you. Good luck.  \n",
      "What a great story! I had something similar happen. We went to the fair last year and I stopped my car to let a dad and son cross in front of me. Two security guards directing traffic stopped me and said because of what I did they were going to let me park in the VIP section. :) I didn't do it for any other reason than to let them safely cross but it benefitted me. Goes to show if we take a minute to think of others we all win. <3 random acts of kindness. :)  \n",
      "SHEW! I have found kindred spirits! Karen, I too have thought about DD's wedding day. ;) I've even gone so far as to imagine perhaps Bmom could start her walk down the aisle then her dad and I take over half way through. So silly how my thoughts drift into such unknown time/space. BriPri, ditto everything you said. DD is 7yo and we have a semi-open adoption so no face to face since DD's birth/hospital visit. Were it not for this woman I would not be a mom. For that I will be forever grateful. In the same token, like you, I am reminded I couldn't get pregnant so this beautiful child did not come from me. MJsmom, I totally understand where you are coming from. Our society is becoming so technologically forward, ie: Apple's new iPhone w/Skype, there's no telling what it will be like when my DD gets to be your DD's age. You're right, it is a good thing but still... I have the utmost respect for the woman who gave birth to the little girl who calls me Mom but there will always be that nagging voice way back in the recesses of my mind, well, you all understand. (((HUGS)))  \n",
      "DD is multi-racial, Native Am being one of her races. Bmom is not registered nor is anyone in her family that she knows of. We did not have to go through the tribe since there was no registration. The agency did check into it and there were no complications. Best of luck to you, I hope everything works out well for you.  \n",
      "We are into sports also. DD was in gymnastics for a while but when she couldn't do some of the same things the other girls were doing she coped a major 'tude, stuck her bottom lip out and folded her arms. It cost too much for her to get nasty and quit without trying so we let that go until she gets older and she doesn't get in the way of herself. We've been doing t-ball/softball for the past four years. IMO its paid off because this year she's had a major change in how she approaches the game. She even stands at the plate like she's a big bad-A. She still gets distracted in the outfield but pays attention when she's catcher. This year was the first year for swimming and she really excelled far beyond what her dad and I ever dreamed. She took to it like it was second nature. She has a big competitive streak and this sport has made her push herself. She's typically a person that if she \"gets\" something right away she loves it but any extra work she has to do she backs off. Not the case with swimming. She tried so hard she earned the Coach's Trophy. I was very pleased to say the least but she and her dad strutted around like new skool Barry Bonds and old skool Reggie Jackson. ;) To sum it up coach-wise we've had good experiences and confidence-wise, well, that's been invaluable. BTW, if anybody has seen our Daddy, NOBODY will say/do anything to Big Girl, not if they want to walk again. Just like Supa, police/ambulances would be involved. I'm just sayin'.  \n",
      "My prayers go out to your friends. There are no words to express the sadness. (((HUGS)))  \n",
      "Sorry your family is having to deal with this. Living in a large metro area is no reason for her to be late. Everyone knows to leave early because something is ALWAYS going to happen. If she's a mom herself then she should know child care comes first, attitude gets checked at the door. Hope everything goes well for you today. Glad your hubby's home. :)  \n",

      "Crick, I'm so sorry. I have no words sending (((hugs))) My DD goes to a charter school simply because our public school is really in bad shape. Schools are closing and overcrowding has begun. We do have a supplies list but not specific requests for brand names. There is no transportation but everyone knows that going into it. There's only three classes for each grade. Also we only go up to 8th grade so when high school comes around we'll have to make some decisions. I don't look forward to that. I hope you find the answers you're looking for. I hate politics sometimes get in the way of our kids education.  \n",

      "I can soooo relate. CAT the guilt I feel is not towards God or my religious beliefs. DH wanted to start trying very early in our relationship and IMO the timing was not right. Hindsight is 20/20. By the time I was ready it was \"too late.\" We went through three rounds of IUI only to come up NOT pregnant. My man was so supportive but I was extremely heartbroken. The last time was just before the Christmas season and I couldn't imagine going through it one more time. Steph, I'm so sorry your \"friend\" told you pregnancy sucked. Very rude. I have a friend who was also TTC at the same time and she was afraid to tell me she was PG for fear I would be more upset. I actually felt bad she was trying to spare my feelings. I let her know God had a plan for both of us and that I was truly happy for her. After her baby was born it just made me more excited for my future baby. Today our girls are great friends and call each other \"cousin.\" That was more than seven years ago and I now have the privilege to be the mom of a beautiful (inside & out) little energy-filled girl. My community is coming up on a very unfortunate anniversary of the kidnap/murder of a little girl. She was only five years old and more than half of her life mom was in jail and the father was totally absent. When the cameras were rolling he was father of the year. Ugh! His excuse was, \"me and her ma don't get along very good.\" Yep, good reason to abandon your child. When mom was out of jail her boyfriend was a guy on the sex offender list and not suppose to be around children. To this day nobody knows who did it. Another girl in town has her boys stay with her mom when she's in jail for drunk driving. She gave birth a couple of years ago and something happened and that baby died, if rumour is to be believed under suspicious circumstances. She's since had yet another baby. These two situations are the times I get funky about not being able to get pregnant. On a day-to-day basis I could care less but then something like that happens and I want to scream. Thanks for starting this thread Ocean, it feels theraputic to have kindred souls out there who share my story. I also want to add Raven your post made me cry. I've read some of your previous posts in other threads and you've mentioned going through some rough times. Giving back to others is great! Keep up the good work!  \n",
      "I agree with the answer, \"it runs in the family.\" I also agree with a PP, people are usually commenting on a striking feature and not necassrily looking for an answer. The people who are looking for an answer don't get what they're looking for with me because I can tell they're fishing.  As far as being a single parent that wouldn't bother me one bit, but that's just me. In fact, the gossip out there about me is FAR more interesting than the truth. I bet you ladies did not know I'm a stripper! That's right, Deja Vu is my home away from home. People are going to say whatever they want to about you whether you correct them or not. Some folks are not truly interested in the truth, just the juice. I don't share with outsiders DD's adoption story but then again if I had concieved/given birth I wouldn't tell that story either. We don't deny our family was formed through adoption, that would be like denying DD's Bmom/family and that wouldn't be right. Then again, the whole world does not need to know our story.  You ladies have provided some great answers.  \n",
      "OMG Port I am seriously LOL! Josie, pearls! HaHa!  I read an article and some of the contestants said the wanted to be VS models so I suppose if they wanted to get VS attention that would do it.  I just dislike that \"The Donald\" is behind all of this. It appears to me he's exploiting these young girls and they're going for it thinking it's going to take them somewhere.  Supa, you know I love you. The pics were HOT but a little too hot for Miss America/USA whichever it is. You hit the nail on the head, CLASSY. I disliked the comments of the chicky poo (party girl Miss America/USA) I saw this morning.  BTW Supa you know you could do the VS and teach those girls a thing or two. :evilgrin: I've seen your lingere pics and they looked nothing like the pics I saw this morning, they were much better. ;)  \n",

      "I traveled seven years ago and everything went fine. I echo others on bringing enough diapers/wipes, never know how many you'll need. I missed my flight because I didn't get there in time for them to the extensive luggage search so I was stuck at the airport for hours with a 12-day old baby, ugh! Having said that the searches are MORE extensive these days so I would check with the airline on what baby items they allow. I like the idea of preparing bottles ahead of time and buying water once past security as a PP stated. IMO the sling is a good idea over a carseat because you keep baby close. Who knows how much the airline will charge for a carseat since they seem to be fee crazy these days. Another thing I felt was important and that is, don't bring a bunch of extra stuff with you. There's a Target, Kmart, Wal-Mart, Walgreen's, or Rite-Aid EVERYWHERE. Bring the items that you feel will be special for baby but essentials can be found anywhere at any time of day or night. Don't forget the tech stuff too. Laptop, mp3 player w/speaker (loaded with lullabyes), cell phone and charger, camera/camcorder. Good luck and congrats on your match!  \n",

      "I have a question to those of you who have a lot of hair. My DD has tons of it. A co-worker and I were discussing DD one day and I mentioned DD gets hot very quickly and easily. She gets pink cheeks, sweats and genreally miserable. My co-woker has almost identical hair to DD and she suggested perhaps because she has so much hair this might be the reason she gets so hot. Has anyone ever heard of this? Is this possible? Is it almost like wearing a hat 24/7? It never occured to me but I'm guessing it's possible. Perhaps I should start bring a squirt bottle to cool DD off when she starts feeling this way. Could you give me your thoughts and opinions on this? ETA: I've added a picture so you can see how much she has. She's had it cut since this photo but just the length has changed. We didn't get it thinned out it's just shorter. [ATTACH]84811[/ATTACH]  \n",
      "I never thought about it before either Becky. My co-worker said she gets hot very fast also so I was just wondering if there really is a connection. I don't have a lot of hair so I can't relate. I just kind of wanted to see if others felt the same way.  \n",
      "Thanks for the replies. Maybe there is something to it since all of you feel the same way. Magic I never thought about the heat absorbing because her hair is dark but that's another theory to go along with it. Amber, her neck also gets very hot.  \n",
      "I have the Epson either 200 or 400 series, sorry not sure. Its an all-in-one and I really love it. This past Christmas I ran out of cards so I scanned it and printed up a few more. (I only needed 3 and wasn't about to buy 20 more) they turned out really nice. That being said the ink is REALLY expensive, $60! I paid a little over $100 for the printer so I won't be printing many pictures. The Walgreens.com is really cheap and easy. I too have made photo books and set up albums online. I like this idea because if anything happens to my computer my pics are safe.  \n",
      "I echo everything Gwen72 said. I use to work in dentistry and the peds dentist actually encouraged parents/guardians back with her. I think if a parent has angst about dental procedures the children will pick up on it. This can sometimes make for a difficult appointment on everyone. Using the HIPPA law is just a way around anxious parents. If you're ok with the one-way mirror then go for it but if not you have every right to back with your child.  \n",
      "It is possible to detect decay without x-rays. The dentist uses the explorer (pointed instrument) by pushing into the pit (deepest part of tooth) if it sticks then its decay. X-rays detect decay between teeth which is unusual for young kids, not impossible just not the first spot young ones form decay. Also depending on the age of the patient x-rays are not usually taken until age 5 or later. They aren't ones to sit still so most dentists don't want to expose them to x-rays that probably won't turn out. I still think you should go back if you want to and no amount of the dentist/staff telling you its against the rules should stop you. Its great your son is comfortable going back by himself but there's nothing wrong with you going back with him. The dentist/hygenist can answer questions you may have right away or make suggestions if necessary. Good luck to you and I hope my response is helpful.  \n",
      "I've been reading this thread with great interest. Our situation is slightly different, DD was a domestic infant adoption. She just turned seven but the past year has been talking about her Bfamily. Recently she shared with one of her friends she is adopted and he asked me about it when I picked her up from afterschool care. We talked about it later and she told me she's told other friends but didn't want to \"give it away.\" When I asked her what she meant she didn't have the words to describe her feelings so I asked if she meant her memories. She said yes then wanted to snuggle with me. DD loves to draw and write so I feel journaling would be a great way to help her. She already has a diary/journal she carries with her everywhere she goes. My thought is getting a special journal specfically for this purpose. Thanks to everyone for your suggestions even though I didn't start this thread it came at a great time for DD.  \n",
      "Oh, Ocean, I sooo feel your pain. I'm putting off a chore right now that I dread to do. I'm trying not to pass this along to DD so she doesn't find herself eyeball deep in a project and too overwhelmed to dig her way out.  DD is seven now and she has her nightly chores/jobs to do. First thing's first, get that nasty litter box done! BLECH! Then feed kitty, wash hands and get cracking on her homework.  I've read, and tried to implement, if one has a big project set a timer and stop once the time is up. That way you can see progress and won't feel sensory overload when looking at it. We also have a spot where everything goes. Right now the dining room is the pitstop for her backpacks, hang them on the chair and they don't get lost. I try to do laundry throughout the week so it's not a big pile at the end of the week. I'm bad about putting them away after folding so they stay in the basket. This is something I'm working on.  The main thing is don't be so hard on yourself. Do the best you can and spend the time with those adorable kiddos. As long as the kitchen and bathrooms are clean and the rest of the house ok then you're doing well. I don't know how you do it. Those little ones must keep you running.  Best of luck to you from one procrastinator to another.  \n",

      "This is too funny! I think we must be urban/suburban. We can walk/bike ride to most places but Wal-Mart is definitely a drive. Zoos and museums are a drive but only 30-45 minutes. Yesterday when I picked DD up from the Y she asked if I walked, when I told her yes she thought I meant from our house. Yep, we're that close. I told her we had to stop by the grocery store she asked if we could leave our vehicle at home and walk to Kroger. Yep, we're that close too. We walk or bike ride to parks, the library and downtown restaurants. No sushi or exotic eateries but nice local places. Our local newspaper doesn't go so far as describing Miss Dot's family outings but the obits and police blotter are the first things read by anyone who subscribes to the paper. We have a wonderful jazz festival in the summer but its the county fair that brings people in from three states. At Christmas a farm town about 20 minutes away has a \"lighted\" Christmas parade. They literally string lights on their tractors and have a parade through town that shuts the streets down for the three day festival. Its expanded over its 30 year history so many different people get in on the act. I'm proud of being able to bike as much as we do but unfortunately most times around here if your biking it probably means you have absoutely NO other means of transportation or your license has been taken away. The latter also means your name's been in the police blotter so everyone knows why you're on a bike. We have a very large high school here. About 600 per class. This concerns me but if DD is going to go to college what better way to introduce her to people and their differences than jumping in feet first. We have a private Catholic school that has a very tough cirriculum but IMO its more of a status thing than an educational opportunity. I've even heard one person say he sends his kids there so he won't have to go to church. WT...?! It is cool to be able to go to the edge of town and watch the deer or see if the eagles are tending their nest. Those kinds of things are good memories for DD. Its not a bad place to raise kids but the idea of living in NY or Chicago would thrill me to no end. I just wish it were not so cold in those places. If my fantasy of winning the Mega Millions comes true and I get to leave Michigan I would need to find a warmer place to be.  \n",

      "Ok, so I logged on to catch up on the \"Confessions\" thread and read this so I also have some input.  First, to the OP. You did fine. Like anything, baby steps. Asked and answered. There will be more questions and you can be more descriptive with your answers. Secondly, when my DD discovered her \"bump\" we talked about it right away. To be honest I call her whole vaginal region her vagina. It honestly didn't occur to me until reading these posts that I should, break down as it were, the different parts of the vagina. I'm not skiddish about using correct terminology at all, it just didn't occur to me.  I am coming from a mother that NEVER used correct terms. She described an erection as, \"a surge of love.\" That being said I didn't get a very healthy or correct sex ed from her. Bless her heart, she's from the era where women were too proud to get a hysterectomy because they didn't want to lose their \"female parts.\"  My DD is an only child too. I have recently been thinking about going to the library to check out a book with pictures on the subject so I can educate her correctly.  Unfortunately she has caught us in our \"Mommy/Daddy\" time and I was like a deer in the headlights. :eek: I had absoutely NO answers for her except to deny what she saw. I know, bad mom. To my knowledge she doesn't know what the word sex is and if she has she's not said it around me. Now is the time for me to explain it to her correctly before some other kid puts ridlicious knowledge in her head.  Quantum thanks for the book link. The one review I read suggested it would be best for 10yo but I bet it could be broken down for a younger child, DD is 7.  \n",

      "kellyjamesThe wanting-to-go-to-the-bathroom ALONE thing? I'd thought it was bad enough with my four-year-old constantly coming in since he was a toddler (\"what woo doing?\" and then later, \"why are you sitting down to pee?\" \"are you pooping? Have you pooped yet? Is it smelly?) and then I get this maniac puppy who wants to come in and sit down and stare at me while I, um, do my business. I locked her out one day and then saw this PAW appearing under the door repeatedly...even worse than a little hand!! LOL. I did laugh, but felt in major need of an escape!! OMG! I can totally relate! My dd is almost seven and doesn't go into the bathroom as often as she use to. We now have this crazy cat who has to go in with me. I'll close the door but not all the way and the next thing I know he pushes it open and comes in wanting me to pet him. EWWWW!  There are some days my dd knows which buttons to push and then other days she's a gem. Kids know how far they can go. When I work overtime and I've been driving all night long, she knows I'm whipped. She's so helpful and doesn't expect a lot from me. Then there are those days when I work a regular shift and she's, she's, well...a kid. A normal kid so why should we be anything but normal moms?  Ok, so our halos slip sometimes. Just because we ask God for a family doesn't mean we expect our world to be perfect. Sometimes if helps all involved to take a break from each other, regroup and come back together.  \n",
      "portlowskiI have been getting 2 conflicting thoughts on the subject and I am having a hard time reconciling them...some people have said DS knows I am sick and he is worried about me so I need to comfort him, others think it's just a play for attention and say ignore him. I don't want to encourage bad behavior but I also don't want him to think that I will ignore him if he is feeling true anxiety. I'll just have to figure out how to cope with these 2 conflicting ideas...but I agree that closing the door and locking it is a good idea. My sister even suggested that I leave out the front door and then sneak in the back door to my room for a nap. I thought the same thing. Your sister's idea is a good one. I was thinking perhaps the sitter could take him out of the house for a while until you get settled in your room with the door closed then they can return and resume their activities.  The little people in our lives know a lot more than we realize. He might be afraid for your health. It's a \"catch-22\" when it comes to this situation. You need your rest so you can get better but he needs you at the same time. You can't get better without your rest so he needs to let you alone for some time.  My prayers to you for a speedy recovery. I hope your little guy gets the comfort you need.  \n",
      "(((HUGS))) for your loss.  When I was your DD's age my grandfather passed away. My mother made the choice to bring me and my two younger siblings to the funeral home. I have a cousin that is the same age I am. His mother didn't bring him to say good-by to Papa. I vividly remember my dad holding me at the casket and my Mom crying her heart out. I felt like I should be sad but didn't understand why. At least I knew Papa was gone and when we went to visit he wouldn't be there. My cousin on the otherhand looked for Papa weeks after the funeral because he didn't know he had passed away. I took from that sad situation that kids need to know about death because, unfortunately, it's a part of life.  I have taken my DD to funerals since she was small because of how my Mom introduced me to that aspect of life. I tell her the person is sleeping with Jesus now. She's almost seven now and understands (as far as a 7yo can understand) death.  To conclude I feel like the previous posters, kids know and understand things very well even at a young age. My best to you and your family.  \n",

      "I'm with you. We don't own a Wii or a gameboy and she is TOTALLY oblivious to Saturday morning cartoons.  She does have an mp3 player but music is extremely important to her father and I so for her have one is a given. As a matter of fact my 6yr old \"teenager\" is in her room listening to it right now.  We're like Alcee's family, no tv Monday through Thursday and then on weekends it's pretty much my shows when it's on. When DD's watching tv it's more than likely one of her movies. I do have a BlackBerry which comes in handy when we are somewhere not kid friendly and patience is running low, I'll pull up the Disney channel. Reading is VERY important in this family so when she came home from school talking about wanting to read AR books my heart nearly beat out of my chest with pride. Last night she told me she expressed to her teacher she wanted to read a chapter book! Imagine a 1st grader actually asking for a bigger, longer book to read! Guess how I'm feeling right now?! We're chilling until the library opens then we're off to find a chapter book. Perhaps Magic Tree House. She also said something about Junie B. Jones. Like anything technology can be used for good or bad. We chose to look at the positives. Hopefully we can keep it that way and find a good balance as she and the tech world grow. I do think it's important to keep up as much as possible because some of these games do come with internet access. Even if they don't have a computer in their room it's possible to get on without you (collective) even knowing.  When I was growing up my family was one of those that had the tv on ALL the time. Life was pretty unstructured which is probably why I'm kind of (ok not kind of, actually very) anal about that now. I think it's important to be aware of this even though your little guy is young. Our world is evolving very fast so we as parents need to keep up. Keep up the good work, you're a good mom for thinking of these things early on.  \n",

      "Storm, repeat after me, I am a good mom!  It's difficult not to micro-manage DH when he's with E because you've been with him all day. Walk away when he's \"helping\" so you can get some rest.

E is going through a very difficult sickness right now so it's going to take a bit of time for him to recover, don't be so hard on yourself. :grouphug:  \n",
      "Saya  The idea is that you want your child to learn to put themselves to sleep, but you also don't want them to feel abandoned. So you pick an amount of time that you'll start out leaving them alone the first night. Maybe you start with 5 minutes, maybe 1 minute, it's up to you. So you put your child to bed \"drowsy but awake\" as they say, and walk out, and if they protest you come back in whatever time period you've picked. When you come back in you don't take them out, you just speak to them soothingly and tell them they need to go to sleep, and then leave again. Then if they keep crying/protesting, come back in again after a slightly LONGER increment of time. E.g. if you waited 3 minutes last time, maybe add a couple of minute and come back in five minutes later. And if she keeps crying, next time come back 7 minutes later, etc. (The idea is you're still able to go in and sooth but they're not learning \"hey if I scream for XX minutes mommy and daddy will definitely pick me up.\") If however it sounds like she's NOT protesting quite so vehemently, like she's calming down or getting sleepy, don't go in. Let her fall asleep. Each family has to do what's right for them. I'm now a firm believer in the importance of sleep, and in the knowledge that sometimes I have to be firm, no matter how hard it is, for my child's long term health. I can't say I'm knowledgable with the Ferber method but I have watched on TV what Saya is describing and it worked. Ok, it was SuperNanny, but once she convinced the parents to stick to the plan it worked. It was painful watching the parents agonize over their child crying, it stressed the parents as much as the child. In the end it did work.  I'm like a PP when it comes to my child getting the right amount of sleep. It shows in her school work, her attitude and her attention span. When she's tired she can't focus on anything.  When she was a baby I made sure she got those naps. If it meant not getting out of the house for the entire day so be it.  Hope things start to work for you, I know it's got to be tough. You'll get through it ok once you find out what works for your family.  \n",

My agency also had the number to the hotel and room number of where we were staying so they called periodically to check on us. You know I'm from MI and it's not like they're quick but it's not the worst I've ever heard of either. We were gone from home for 11 days. This included a holiday. DD was born on the Wednesday before Good Friday. So while I'm not sure of the legalities each agency has a policy they strictly adhere to.  Hang tough. My thoughts have been with you.  \n",
      "SupaModelI come here for support and to talk to other parents that are like me. I would like to talk about my joys, fear, excitement etc... without getting judged or a lesson.  I honestly feel that there is a bias on the boards. With the big bad AP's and our selfish wants and desires. I also feel like with some of the Mods we have a much shorter leash than the otherside. Some of the thing I have read in Adoption Parents Support I know wouldnt be allowed on the otherside. So for the most part I dont post as much anymore. I am learning to steer clear of certain threads, members etc... and just try and get what I need and move on. I have a tendency to agree with you Supa. You and I both responded to a post and I was saddened by how the OP topic took a life of its own by other members. I do not want to make this an \"US vs THEM\" thing. Adoption is a triad so let's work together because in the end it's about the children which is why I think most of us came here in the first place.  \n",
      "quantumJust for curiosities sake, who is 'us' and 'them'?I ask this because it seems like in some of the more 'controversial' topics that there are people from all sides of the triad taking all sides.  Or am I just being naive? In the particular post I replied in it seemed the Bmoms had one opinion and the Amoms had another which was pointed out to me. After that comment I replied no further because I didn't want it to turn into a post of each mom pitted against one another. The children are why we're all here in the first place, IMO, and since it wasn't my post to begin with I didn't want it to turn into something it wasn't so I let it drop. It just made me sad when it appeared the OP was kind of \"corrected\" in public when the full story was not disclosed.  I want it to be a true triad and the kids not pulled one way or the other.  \n",

      "greenrobinMy friend had a cat that lived for 18 years. She'd had the cat since before she married and had children. So, when the cat's health began to fail, my friend was distraught. The day finally came when the vet said that the only thing he could do was put her to sleep. My friend was crushed. But because she loved her pet, she chose to do this because her beloved kitty was in so much pain. She went home and tried to pull it together, but everything she did set her off. Her 4 yr old son found her sitting in the kitchen, staring at the oven and crying. She tried to explain it by telling him she was sad because her cat had died. The little boy pondered that for a moment, looking from mom to the oven.  \"Oh,\" he said, \"so we're eating her for supper?\" And my friend went to sad to laughing just like that. Your story started off kind of sad because I went through the exact same thing about three years ago. When you followed up with the mom in the kitchen crying I LMAO! I'll be thinking about that one for a while. :D  \n",

      "I agree with the others, if the eparents have given you \"permission\" to change the baby's name then they are giving you their blessings.  As for middle names I have a VERY strong opinion about that. It's a personal thing. I was born in the south as were my parents. For some reason, perhaps cultural, folks were given a first, middle and of course last name but called by their middle name. I am one of those. I never understood it. My parents gave me a first name but NEVER used. This was so aggrivating growing up. Imagine sitting in class as the teacher reads off everyone's name for roll call and you blow the teacher off because the name just called out is totally foreign to you. Flash forward a few years and you go for your driver's license, you can't use the name you go by because \"legally\" you are not recognized by a middle name.  Ok, rant over. Follow your heart.

On DD's first day of K we were both so excited neither of us even thought of crying. On her last day they did songs and presentations of things they learned and ended with passing out of awards.

I used the opportunity to explain the real reason we celebrate Christmas. She seemed to understand but asked where the presents came from. I just looked at her and smiled, she realized it was me and daddy. She got a thoughtful look on her face and asked about the tooth fairy. I just looked at her again and smiled.

Fortunately both women understood my emotion of the miracle of adoption and sweetly said we were both very blessed. I've stopped approaching strangers and just blinked away my tears and shouted inside.  Maybe as the others suggested this woman may have more to her than you have learned through your playgroup.

      "I need some words to help comfort my 5 year old DD. Friday her kindergarten teacher sent home a note that one of the student's father had died. She sat the children down and explained that M's father died and that she would be very sad in her heart. The teacher wanted us, the parents, to know that she had talked with them and that perhaps they would have some questions they might want answered. After reading the note I became emotional and didn't want to start the conversation right away but rather wait until she brought it up. It wasn't long before we got home when she told me something sad happened at school that day. We sat down on the couch and I let her tell me what happened. She told me what Mrs. G told them at rug time and she got tears in her eyes. I had already shed my tears but they started welling up again. My little rock got up and got me tissues and comforted me. I thought after we discussed it she would be alright. It must have been on her mind all evening because when it came time to go to bed her little mind started swirling. She slept with me that night (she managed to \"convince me\" that since my sinuses were bothering me and I was sick she needed to sleep with me so she could take care of me) and the minute the lights were off she wanted to know if Daddy and I were going to leave her and if her birthfamily loved her. My heart was breaking for my sweet baby. I told her that we wouldn't leave her and that yes her birthfamily loves her. I felt like a liar because nobody knows when their time is up. I didn't want to promise this innocent child something I knew may not be true. Daddy was working midnights that night so we talked about it the next day and we sat down with her and told her we wouldn't be leaving her.  We live in a small town and news travels fast. You'll never believe it but I found out the dad committed suicide because that day he was served divorce papers. You have got to be kidding me. Now my emotions are all over the place. I'm angry at him, sad for his daughters and worried that my DD will think we are leaving her.  Please help me with the words to talk to DD because it's still on her mind. Last night she called me into her room to tell me she loved me and Daddy because we would never leave her.  What would any of you suggest I say to ease her mind and put her worries to rest?  \n",
      "Thanks for your responses. I did not tell her that he committed suicide because it's difficult enough for me to understand much less expect a 5 year old to understand.  We have had pets that died and that day we discussed their passing. One passed due to age and the other got sick. I don't think she relates this to humans but she did discuss her feelings of missing them and their likes and dislikes.  That's a good idea to let her know we don't plan or choose to leave her.  \n",
      "Thanks EZ for your thoughts. We didn't think it was necessary to explain it was a suicide either. She will never understand that. We will change our wording as you and Bajj suggested to we don't plan to leave you.  She has brought it up every once in a while this week so I let her talk and reassure her.  I pray for the family as they deal with their own feelings and emotions. Certainly a tragedy for all concerned.  \n",

I understand you wanting to get home soon but enjoy those quiet days at the hotel because when you get home friends and family will want to come and visit. This is a great time to bond with your baby. A nurse at DD's hospital told me in order for my baby to bond with me we should \"kangaroo.\" She suggested we have skin to skin contact and wrap a blanket around us to keep us warm and close. Those were actually some nice times in my memory book. All my best to you.  \n",

That was the best thing I ever did. No worries about what or where to eat. A big plus on that plan too is that I didn't have to worry about how much the food cost, it was prepaid so all I did was look at the menu and picked out my favorite. We had lunch with the princesses and dinner with Pooh and friends. We can't wait to go back. Her birthday is coming up and she keeps talking about it so we are going to have to go back soon.

In our situation bmom doesn't have communication with her own father so the amount of NA is unclear or how far it goes back. We did not have to go through ICWA we just had to wait for ICPC to clear which is different from state to state. I thought it all depended on where the child is born as to what laws applied.

Now comes the gobble gobble and the ho ho ho. Is everyone ready for that ride? :woohoo:  \n",
      "These stories are great! When DD was 3 years old she had the most difficult time potty training when it came to the poop part. One day at day care she was in the bathroom when the teacher looked at her and said, \"E are you pooping?\" DD gave her the thumbs up and said, \"Rock on Miss Kathy.\" I bust out laughing and still chuckle when I get an image of that scene.  \n",
      "Sorry I didn't elaborate. :eek: There are two teachers. One teacher stays in the room with the kids and she sends two in at a time into the adjoining bathroom while one teacher is in the bathroom to monitor them. Of course the two they send in are girl/girl, boy/boy. Sorry for the confusion.  Stormster, :rolleyes: Hope that dream doesn't come true!  \n",
      "I understand what you mean about everyone \"wanting one\" after you have a cutie of your own. When I brought my big girl home all of a sudden there was a huge interest about adoption. Yes, she's beautiful and loaded with persoanlity but it's not like an order can be placed for a \"fake\" child.  I use the term big girl loosely, she's a peanut herself. Her entire summer wardrobe consists of clothes I bought for her when she was three years old. I'm not complaining, saves on the wallet. E wears out her clothes before she outgrows them. They are a little shorter at age five than when she was three but still fit perfect. Both of DD's bparents are on the shorter side. People who don't know she's adopted look at me (5'6\") and DBfriend (6') and can't figure out why she's so petite. Ty is a little sweetie!  \n",
      "I agree with the others. My daughter was the same way. There will come a time when he will not let you out of his sight so don't worry about that.  My DD is now five years old and she has the best imagination. She has NEVER complained about being bored. She has an entire rock family and each one has a been assigned a position, e.g. Mom/Dad/sister/brother. She's quite content playing alone but loves it when I join in.  I'm sure you're a great mom, take it from another 40something. Hang in there. :cheer:  \n",
      "I liked this story because not only did it show this young man that other kids have families like his but he also saw another child that is adopted like him. It warmed my heart.  \n",
      "I have a question for everyone. My DD is one of the most feminine little girls in the world. She is in LOVE with the Disney princesses, Barbie, Bratz, also fancy hair and dresses, polished nails, you name it.  She has one thing \"boyish\" that she likes and that is Spiderman. Her Daddy likes Spiderman to this day so this is something they share. She decided last summer that her birthday party (which is tomorrow) is going to be Spiderman.  We were in a department store and she was pointing out all the Spiderman toys when she found a fishing pole, a gentleman standing there looking over the poles noticed she liked the Spiderman and quickly pointed out the Barbie one and didn't she want that one instead. I didn't want to interject because she had her mind set that she wanted Spiderman. The only thing I could think of was, what difference does it make? Why does she HAVE to like only girly things. I like that she is head strong and knows what she likes. I think it's cool that she likes Spiderman.  Does anyone else have an issue about gender specific toys? When we go to fast food restaurants that give a choice of boy/girl toys I let her choose.  I was just wondering what everyone else's opinion was and what do they do when given a choice.  \n",
      "Thanks for all your replies. Everyone had a blast at the party. I'm pleased to report it was a success. :banana:  I didn't end up getting the fishing pole but Daddy bought her a Spidey bicycle. She was so excited her eyes were as big as saucers. She tried to ride it around but the water park has rather cramped party rooms.  I spoke with a mom from DD's day care and she said she wanted her eldest to get use to the idea of being a big bro so she got him a baby doll. He nurtured it much to Dad's chagrin :eek: . I thought it was a great idea since it prepared him for a little one around the house.  My DD is a very decisive little girl and I really try to encourage that. Once she has her heart set on something she knows what she wants.  BTW she mostly got Barbie Mariposa stuff and a Hannah Montana CD/DVD. If you asked her which was her favorite it would depend on the minute she's asked as to which she would choose. She loves it all.  I just can't believe my BABY is going to be 5! :hissy: They grow up TOO fast!  \n",
      "I TOTALLY embarrassed myself one time doing that. My DD was still a tiny baby and we were at the fair when I saw a mom with her DD obviously born in an Asian country. I went up to her to start a conversation and being so overwhelmed with emotion I started crying! YIKES! She was cool about it after I collected myself and explained rationally what I was saying. She just said we were both very fortunate to have our DDs. I swore I'd never do that again! I too would love to have a close group and while there are parents at DD's daycare whose families are formed through adoption we never have seemed to click with getting together. That's why I like coming here, at least I have someone who can relate.  \n",
      "I went from MI to IA and stayed 11 days. I stayed at one of those hotels that was a suite. It was almost like a small apartment. We went to the mall and walked around, to the library and walked on the treadmill at the hotel. The rest of the time stayed at the hotel where my daughter and I bonded. A nurse at the hospital told me that my daughter needed to learn my smell and heartbeat so we relaxed on the couch with her on my chest talking to her and telling her what to expect when we got home. The whirlwind started when we got home so I took this time to relax and enjoy the one on one time with her. Good luck. Helayne  \n",
      "I agree with the others, don't even worry about a carseat. My DD hated a sling but if it works for you then do it. It is great for bonding, baby can hear your heartbeat, learn your smell, etc.  Wait until you get home to buy all the big stuff or perhaps receive it as a gift from your babyshower. The regulations for security are crazy especially if you are going to a bigger airport. No, bottled water will NOT pass security. I agree with a previous poster to use the pre-mixed, they're easy and since your mind will be preoccupied then it'll be one less thing you have to think about. A paci is a good idea since little one's ears could feel yucky on take off and landing. My DD did great. IMO when I fly anymore I carry as little as possible, which is what the airline's goal is, just to eliminate any delays.  I had to remove my DD from her carseat, fold down the stroller and send it all through the cameras, I had just spent 11 days by myself with a baby in a hotel so accomodating them was the last thing my tired mind wanted to do. Make it as easy on yourself as possible. Carry the extra clothes, diapers, blankets, and premixed bottles. The main thing is to relax since the babes can sense your frustration.  Good luck.Helayne  \n",
      "I am new to this site and have enjoyed reading the responses. KAT, I loved your response. I too have had a few insensitive remarks. My dd is multiracial/cultural so people comment on her beauty all the time. She has long brown/black curly hair and big black eyes. Ironically I was in Target also when a woman asked about her ethnicity. She was very young at the time so I was very green about intrusive questions so I answered her, her response was, \"Is the father still around?\" I just stood there stunned and said yes. She even followed us when we left the area we were shopping. Another time we were in the grocery store when at the checkout the clerk asked about her ethnicity, I rattled everything off and her response was, \"Is the dad from around here?\" I just told her no, paid my bill and left her there with an open mouth.  There are days when you will feel like educating the world and then your patience is real thin on other days. I agree with the response of asking a person why they ask and that turns it around on them. This makes the person think about why they have asked and why they are asking it. Then there are days when someone will restore your faith in human kind. My dd has a friend from her school and he is VERY cc, blond (almost white) hair, blue eyes, and FAIR complexion. We were at the grocery store in one of the car grocery carts when an elderly lady chatted with us about how handy the carts were. My dd loves talking to people so she told the lady her name and the lady smiled and asked what her brother's name was. I almost burst with pride that she thought we were family when nothing about our outward appearance would tell the casual observer that we were related.  Good luck in the future as I am going to keep checking back myself to hone my responses to silly questions.

      "I'd like to offer a perspective not as a birthmother but a mother plain and simple... Everything you described completely legitimates you wanting to still protect her even though she is 20, more that most mothers would want to protect their 20 year olds. After all, our babies are our babies for life no matter how old they are! But look at it this way: you can monitor FB contact in ways that you wouldn't be able to monitor letters and phone calls. If she is contacting her bmom, you can see it and be there to support and comfort her even if she doesn't come outright and tell you whats going on. You can see the online threads firsthand. Just thought that might help to look at it that way....  \n",
      "Yet another vote to save them all. It might be hard to tell when is the right time to show the letters, but it may be wise to do so before there is any chance of direct contact. It would definately help for a more informed decision on whether contact should be welcomed. And how you present them will speak volumes to your child and could serve to strengthen your relationship even more. Tell them that you want to be honest with them. Tell them you are afraid what you are about to show them will hurt them. Tell them that people can change over the years but that they don't always. You don't want them to hear a completely different version from her first and then have to try to explain the truth to them afterwards.  \n",
      "I don't remember if my daughter's aparents gave me something atthe hospital but they did give me a double sided locket to put SN and SE's pictures in. That meant so much to me and at first I never took it off..... They also sent me a dozen yellow roses that first mother's day which helped me more than they will ever know....  \n",
      "I have pictures of SE and her [adopted] family up at my home. I've always had many framed pictures of her around and showed family, friends and coworkers what her mom sent me over the years. [pictures, not letters. those are personal] Sasha is 16 months older than SE and she has always seen pictures of her sister. To me they are all family and I love them. Seems only natural to share what little I have of them with the world.  \n",
      "I've been off the site for several weeks now and as I sat here catching up I found myself really wanting to hear from aparents about their feelings &/or reasons for not having open adoptions. I think it's because I'm facing the issue of how to send my daughter her christmas gift this year. A little background [highly summarized]: We had a semi-open adoption for the first 5 years with letters and pictures back and forth. When SE turned 5 everything abruptly stopped coming from her parents. I continued to send things to the agency under the belief that they were forwarded to SE and her parents. One call to the agency a few years ago confirmed this then a brushoff in march brought all my fears of the agency cutting off comumication rushing back. I found SE and her parents and sent them a direct letter. I got no response. I posted a letter to them on here and a blog on myspace as I had given them all my website info. No response. So, now, I sit here wondering if some of you would share your thoughts. I know everyone is different and I won't know how they feel until I hear it from them. But it would still be nice to hear from you too. Why do you shy away from contact? Does any of it have to do with feeling that a bmom can destroy what you have with your child? Is it fear that there will be a stronger bond that may just come from biology? Is it something that you know or don't know about the bmom? Is it your child's actions/emotions? It it something that I can't even begin to comprehend because I haven't walked in your shoes? Is it more things than you could begin to put into words? I want to understand. I think hearing might help. Not for advise. I think more to find peace, if that makes any sense. I want to hear whatever you have to say. Blunt. Tactful. Whatever.  \n",
      "Yes I have worried over the years if contact stopped because of some tragedy. Not a pleasant thought but sa realistic one. Their names are fairly common and I didn't even know exactly what town they were in until this march. I'm not the best at internet searches and don't know what newspapers are in their area. Call me crazy but I have this overwhelming desire to take a trip to their town. Not to stalk them, probably not even drive down their road. To walk/drive around and see what she's seen for her 11 years. Maybe drive by the different schools after all the kids go home. Then I could pick up some papers and hopefully they'll have websites to be able to read the local news there. Just to feel a little closer. I know I don't have the right to just show up on their door, and I wouldn't be going up to hunt them down. I don't know how i'd handle it if I bumped into them at a store or park or what-not. I've also thought of trying the number I have. Might not be the right one. They may have changed it. I don't know if they'd answer if I did. And I wouldn't want SE to pick up although the fantasy dances around in my head at times. Thought of having a coworker call just to confirm it is them and they haven't moved. I think about some one calling for me and saying \"Hello. Is this _____? SE's mother/father? I was just calling for my friend, Darci. She wants to know that you're okay and that you got her letter...\" But the thoughts stop there. I have no idea what the reation would be. I try not to play that out. I know I'd be a sobbing mess through the whole thing. I truly don't know what is best. To play it safe and wait and risk missing precious time for a misunderstanding. Or to throw caution to the wind, reach out 100% and risk upsetting everything. I just don't know.  \n",
      "Thank you loveajax! I will not give up on trying to find my answers and peace. SuzySSunshine, I haven't printed it out, but I do talk quite openly with family, friends, co-workers, etc. I get mixed views. Some say to go right up and see what happens. Others say I'm crazy to even think it. Then there's everything in between. I toy with the idea of talking to co-workers in adoption and foster care but have held off because it's a different senerio with them. They deal with removal of children and subsequent placement. That said, I have made a resolve about what to do next. I am buying a house and moving next month. After a lot of thought, I decided to get SE's xmas stuff together and sent it and a letter to her parents after we move. I won't put any identifying marks on the outside incase Se sees it, but I want to sent it so her mom has to sign for it. We'll see if that will help ease the pain for a little longer. And I have to push aside anything else again. You see, my husband has decided to fight for custody of his kids again for reasons I don't feel are right to get into. Life will be crazy while that's going on. I can't risk any of that spilling into SE's life...  \n",
      ":thanks: zxczxcasdasd - Thank you so much for saying what you did! I am so thankful that there are people here who really understand and want to support me {and everyone else}! Coming here always helps when I feel I'm loosing the battle. Helps me cry it out and then let it go again for a while, if that makes any sense. mumofone I hope your kids never say that either. To me Se's parents are her REAL parents. She's my daughter and always will be. But I'm not her mom. Not now anyway. I can only be that if she chooses to make me her mom. I never fed her or changed a diaper. I've never made her laugh or wiped away a tear. Her mom has. Not me. greenrobin, I hope you can find a balance for your kids. It must be hard. I thought about fostering and possible adopting from \"the system\". Not sure I'd be strong enough after loosing SE and going through changes in custody with my step-kids. I think I'd fall apart if I took kids in and they were returned to a home that wasn't really safe or \"good\". I have to deal with something similar every day now and it's killing me. I give you lots of credit for being there for the kids and for understanding/empathising with their other mom.  \n",
      "I read this today in an email from a friend and just wanted to share. It touched me so I thought someone else might enjoy the read as well.... [FONT=\"Comic Sans MS\"]Teacher Debbie Moon's first graders were discussing a picture of a family. One little boy in the picture had a different hair color than the other members. One of her students suggested that he was adopted.  A little girl said, 'I know all about Adoption, I was adopted..'   'What does it mean to be adopted?', asked another child.   'It means', said the girl, 'that you grew in your mommy's heart instead of her tummy!' [/FONT] :grouphug: :grouphug: :grouphug: :grouphug: :grouphug::grouphug:  \n",
      "I truly hope that my daughter has feelings like these. Time will tell!  \n",
      "I work in medicaid in NY. There are lost of reasons for denial. Not filing out paperwork completely, not completing an interveiw, not providing all documentation, too much income, household composition, etc. I can only speak of NY's rules but would be glad to help if you wanted to send a private message.  \n",
      "i don't think I could have dealt with a completely open adoption in the beginning. So many things hurt so bably that direct involvement would have kept wounds too fresh to be able to deal with it all. I loved Sarah and I knew I did what was best for her and for Sasha. I had to put that aside for a while to deal with the rest. But I also know I couldn't have dealt with a completely closed adoption either. The not knowing is killing me now after I have healed in part from the other \"stuff\". But that's me. I have friends who are adoptees from closed adoption who are completely well adjusted with no interest in their birthparents. My cousin was contacted by his bmom but then she pulled away. That's part of what scares me when people talk about researching adoption before making their decisions. People can't be researched and predicted like that. There's too many variables in each person and we are always changing. We can't even really know how we are going to react to things when/if they happen. so how can people say how others are going to react. I've always said that if Sarah's parents called and asked for anything - I would do it in a heartbeat. Every day I hope for a letter in the mailbox or something in one of my inboxes for them. I put their number in my phone in case they choose to call ( i don't care if i'm in with the commisioner - i'd answer!) but I honestly don't know how i'd react. I might loose it. I might not. I think that is waht keeps so many bmoms away. It might not be less painful to tuck everything away and \"forget\" but it is easier. It's easier not telling everyone what you are goingn through so people don't ask all the time. Sorry, i think i lost complete track of where I was even going with this....I do that sometimes....  \n",
      "What a wonderful husband you have!!! I don't know you , but I'm happy for you all the same!!!!  \n",
      "I came into Mjr's life when he was 2 1/2. Just the other day his mom said she hates to admit it but she knows the he feels that his dad and I are his family. Those three years that I was mom were at the time when his more concrete memories where forming. He knows he had someone there before then, but he can't destinguish WHO. A child will bond to whomever is there for them. And I believe any true mother will bond to any child who she cares for day in and day out. Look at how long-time nannies bond with their \"kids\". And that's no where near as close as you'll be to your little baby!  \n",
      "Yes -we sometimes distance ourselves to help with the heartache. As much as I loved see the photos when they used to come, it always made me cry. I can't speak for your bmom, but I would never have felt SE's aparents where being pushy for anything they asked. Emailing every day might be a little much but the thing with emails is if she's feeling vulnerable she can save them and read them whenever she is ready. I might suggest another email before sending the next photos. Tell her you're worried and ask her if she wants more photos, less, different types, etc. It's hard without knowing her but I would definately say to keep to your schedule unless she actually says not to even if you never get any replies back. She may just need time.  \n",
      "I kept a small journal when I was pregnant. I don't think it would have bothered me if they had asked. But I didn't view her as my baby from the time I chose adoption. She was \"our\" baby from that point forward. I might suggest feeling her out. See how she's thinking about the pregnancy and the baby. I have a long-standing philosophy that if you continually think about doing something even after you tell yourself you shouldn't - well that just means you should do it. If that's how you find yourself feeling then maybe you should bring it up with her. Just do it gently.  \n",
      "I'm a birthmother but I still cried for all of you as I read this. Yes I carried her for 9 months but I couldn't imagine loosing an infant you cared for for even a few days. SE's parents had a failed adoption before we were matched. I felt so bad for them. But now they've had her for 11 years. I hope all of you find your matches and that it helps lessen the hurt you feel now. \n",

If the birthfather gets his child back...it's not because you weren't 'good enough' but because it is his inherent right to parent his own child, even if he requires the help of his mother to do so.

We finalized in a small town, so while we sat in the \"witness box\" it was just a little table up next to the judge. The judge asked us questions, but they were not anything bad. He kept asking my husband if he understood that if we got a divorce he would be financially responsible for this child just like a biological child. Because it was so informal where we were I was making comments from where I was sitting about how he would have to pay out the arse. They went over the fact that adoptive children have the same right of inheritance as biological children.  I think it's terrible the judge said that on finalization day!

We want the girls to be able to do all of the activities that the other kids get to participate in. :thanks:If the girls are going to be your kids and the adoption subsidy doesn't cover their activities, I hope you'd make sure that ALL kids get to participate in activities and not just your own. In a family with multiple kids, the budget just has to stretch...  \n",
      "MilehighDadGreenmama, I think she meant the activities portion different than you are assuming. I don't think she was implying that her adopted kids would need funding to participate in activities like her birth kids, I think she was saying that her adopted kids would need funding to participate in activities like other foster kids she has/will have in the home. This is just my guess, but I wanted to say something because both of you were unclear. In particular, I recommend that we all try not to use the term \"your own\" because it isn't specific enough and to me it implies a 2nd-best connotation to adopted kids. I personally consider all my kids \"my own\" and one isn't even finalized yet! Please understand, I'm not being critical because this terminology is certainly common and accepted. I'm just suggesting that maybe there is a better way to communicate between all of us, and maybe it will even spread to the world outside where adoption is so little understood and often misrepresented.Of course the kids are \"hers\" once they are adopted...I just felt as though SHE was setting up a divide between \"hers\" and \"theirs\" when it came to financials...and I don't think that's fair at all.  \n",

      "It was a Friday, hot and sticky early August meeting in the office where dreams are broken and, sometimes, realized. She was pale, clothes ill fitting, shaky hands. After a moment I realized she was scared of me. She spoke of loving her daughter knowing she couldn't do it raising her a daunting task when she could barely take care of herself. Her pain was palpable thick in the air around me. Sorrow. Loss. Her childhood had been everything every mother fears. My heart broke. Shattered. I was bleeding her pain becoming mine. I had expected her to be The Enemy. Mother of this baby girl who had stolen my heart. I could make a choice kindness compassion empathy or bitterness anger and hatred. I could make it worse because, well, she will lose anyway. I chose love. Love for her. Love for our daughter who will always be ours and never just mine. Love and healing in knowing the answers to all the questions our girl might one day have. Knowing the love that wasn't enough to fix all that was wrong and knowing that baby girl has now found love that is. Our daughter. Ours. Past present and future loved. An unexpected gift for every one of us.  \n",

I liked it, too, because it was such a parent thing...a warm hat. Maybe something like that could be a gift possibility.  \n",

The \"gift\" we gave our girls the first meeting was a picture of our dogs. It wasn't planned, but I had them in my purse, and the girls wanted to see them, I could tell they liked them so I told them they could just keep them to look at. All the adopted teens I have known have wanted to share their extracurricular activities with their new family. Some have waited years in foster care to have a mom or dad at their soccer game. It would be very bad to adopt a teenager and prevent any extracurricular activities...not at all the same as adopting young kids like yours!  \n",

      "It is possible to have great influence over a child you adopt at any age. But it's not really about raising a child 'my way' in older child adoption as much as it is about meeting the child where THEY are at and finding your way together. It's not the same as infant adoption. The child comes to you with a personality and fears and a past that they will carry with them forever. Good luck in your quest. You could inquire on hundreds of kids before you are selected but I hope your wait is a short one!  \n",

He has a best friend named Jacob he met on his own. And a bunch of kids sit with him every day at lunch making plans for birthday parties and play dates. My son rides a bike as fast as a racer skidding to a stop with sheer joy of making his mark on this world. My son is Miraculous Defies odds Proved everybody wrong. My son is a gift from God. :love:  \n",

      "We changed our son's name before adoption was finalized (new first, middle and last names) and used his old first name as a middle name. He now doesn't want even THAT...gets mad when we use it at all...so we will be changing the middle name soon to something entirely new.  \n",
      "JRobotChloroxsis, I'm mostly a lurker on these boards, but wanted to write to this to send some distant love and support to your family. This is a very disturbing story, and it sounds like things aren't going well in general. Do you have a counselor who can help you and your daughter with the adjustment? It's so easy to get into a negative spiral of escalation, and it sounds like that's what's happening here. Going to the police and pressing charges against a child is a horrible idea on many levels. As the previous posters have pointed out, kids who have been through the system may have an emotional reaction to the police, and - in any case - kids should be taught that the police are there to protect. During your bad day, it made sense to have the police be the consequence to the stealing. I've been in that emotional state (when I was a classroom teacher years ago) and did try to punish / scare a kid who came to me already hurt by life. I know how it feels like the right thing at the time when you're so angry. You just want the child - your daughter - to do what's right, and you have that strong want because you love her. However, with time and reflection and realizing that using power against a child doesn't get you what want nor does it serve the child. Jeannie W. had some great advice about getting on your daughter's side. That's a much better place to be than against her. Again, I know the board is helpful, but we're not professionals, nor can we sit in the room with you and your daughter and help you learn ways of making it work. If this is more than a passing problem (and it sounds like it is), please please please find a professional to help you figure out how to be a family with love. -Jay You are still waiting to be matched with a child, right? Those of us who already HAVE children adopted from foster care would probably agree that these issues are fairly minor and EXTREMELY COMMON. Chloroxsis is doing a great job...the contract is a fabulous idea and sometimes police are necessary with these kids. Hang in there Chloroxsis. You are doing a great job.  \n",

YOU don't factor in to the equation at all...you will just be default. There isn't ever a competition between who is better or worse....the biofamily doesn't have to win. She belongs to them to start with!  \n",

I would just play it safe For us, we just kept it to us, 'the family', and went out to dinner and then had some ice cream. But that's just us.

      "So this is complicated but I want to run this by more experienced posters. We were matched back in March and FS has been living with us as an adoptive placement. We have lived out the state's minimum for adoption to take place. Paperwork is filed for adoption, etc.  Two months ago, birthfamily filed an appeal to stop the adoption from taking place. That hasn't been ruled on. A month ago they also filed a motion asking that the adoption be \"Stayed\" (ie. postponed) until the appeal has been heard. THIS MOTION was denied. So technically that means the adoption doesn't have to be postponed, right? If the adoption goes through and then the appeal is won...what happens to our FS? Would they then dissolve the adoption??? HELP! Please respond...I am freaking out.  \n",

      "PrettyboicrisI just got a call from the CW for the baby: Recap 2 month old girl (Now 3.5 months) We have been pursuing as an adoptive palcement. The 73 year old Foster mom is trying to keep her despite having a foster only license. FMom requested an independent review to see if she would be allowed to keep the baby and adopt her. SOOOO... The worker called and stated that they would like to schedule a meeting. I forget the kind of meeting that it is called but what happens is the Fmom brings the baby and leaves her in the room with the baby's CW, the ACS reviewer and us to see how we interact with the baby. Also the CW gives us full disclosure on the baby. The Baby then goes back home with Fmom. If we are still interested then ACS reviewer will submit their impressions for the independent review which will decide whether the baby will stay with the FMOM or come to us. They usually do this meeting with older kids but this is what ACS wants in order for a determination to be made. I feel very mixed about this whole thing. The meeting is set up for January 19th so in exactly 2 weeks. Hopefully everything goes well! Have any of you done anything similar to this type of meeting? What should we expect? Wow...that sounds really intimidating! Best wish to you and your wife. I am sure you will do great. Just be yourselves!  \n",

      "What time does she come? Moving day is sooo exciting!  \n",
      "Do you think she is sharing info with them to gain sympathy because she is parent shopping? Or do you think it is something else? I would have the girls play only at your house and not every day. Those same hours should be spent with you doing bonding activities. Good luck! It's not easy....  \n",
      "I was just thinking...one thing we were told in this process is that your child needs a mom and a dad more than anyone else at this point. Friends can come later but this attachment and bonding time is so critical...kind of like with a newborn baby. She *needs* you guys to force the issue...it doesn't make you the bad guys it makes you good parents!  \n",

I am more wondering how it is handled when the foster children receive a lot of extra gifts that biokids don't, etc and what happens when there is a placement that comes very close to holidays?Also, I was wondering if there are many supports in place for gifts for foster children in different areas. There don't seem to be many where we are and I imagine that is difficult for those with many foster kids!And, also, I am just really excited for the holidays and want to start Christmas decorating already, so I wanted to get a Christmas thread going just for fun!  \n",

We didn't bother filling out the forms because he will be legally ours in a few months so we just pay for lunch or give him the choice to bring it if he chooses. Just wondering what everyone else does? I find that we don't have him participate in any free programs because we don't view him as a foster child and instead prefer to treat him like our own.  \n",
      "I am sorry for you that you have been matched with a child who doesnt want to be adopted. Here, they really wait for kids to *want* a family before they match them...because if the child doesn't want it and they sabotage it, that is one more giant loss and disruption that the child will have to get over.

Now that the kids are set for equipment & other stuff, the buying frenzy can stop...which is why I want to start with an allowance. Both kids have savings accounts...that we contribute to. Now I will expect them to contribute as well. As far as bikes and scooters are concerned...we live in a cold/snowy climate and both kids have winter bdays, so those types of things will always just be spring purchases for us...but hopefully they won't need new ones every year!  \n",

      "[QUOTE=jaenelle]I know the answers to these will have to come from whoever approves people to be foster parents in our state, but I wondered if anyone had any general answers to these questions? 1. Do you need a separate room for each child or just a separate bed? separate bed and usually kids of different genders can't share over age 3 or 5 2. My husband and I both work full-time -- is this generally a problem? With states cutting provisions for daycare, it may not be financially feasible to use daycare, in which case school age children may be best for you at this time. Our state always prefers a stay at home parent. 3. We have two (friendly, healthy) cats and a (medium-sized, friendly, healthy, crate-trained) dog, as well as usually some fish. Is any of this a problem? No, you'll just need to provide evidence of shots and medical care, as well as hope they behave a bit when the social workers come for home studies, etc!  \n",

      "I would guess that you're likely to get calls anywhere from infant-age 10 anyway...our CW indicated that they will \"push the envelope\" if they need a placement for a child. So they'd ask you for something outside of your range (most likely) anyway...and it'd be up to you to determine your comfort level at the time. I'd still inquire though just to be sure!  \n",
      "UTbrie Does Ohio pay for daycare? Also, I have a great friend who is a Nanny who graduated from local Nanny and Governess school a few years ago. Would they pay her for childcare or does she have to be a home daycare provider? Since I am single, what happens if I want to go on a date? Who can babysit? I also have three dogs, all have their CGC and two are therapy dogs. How do they handle household pets, do they need to have vet records and behaviour assessments presented? Sorry for all these questions, but I am excited, nervous to begin and have lots of questions! I will appreciate all advice I can get! THANKS :) Hi... not sure if Ohio pays for daycare or not. Some states have cancelled that because of budget cuts. They would not pay someone for childcare who was already getting the maintenance payment from the state...even if she was an in home daycare provider. Pets are fine...our inspector just wanted to see shot records. Your can use anyone to babysit that you feel is safe...unless they limit you for some reason. You can also use respite (in our state at least) for up to 14 days.  \n",

      "PrettyboicrisI'm sorry I wasnt clear but what I meant was that they could choose their comforter and sheets which is fine by us. We would have a plain set but why not give them a choice of what sheets to get. The furniture we will definitely pick. I have neices and a nephew and all of them when they were old enough were allowed some say in the decoration of their room such as the them of the sheets and little $5- $10 toy attachments for the ceiling fan (My nephew has spiderman on his). They also got to pick their night light/mini lamp. All that stuff together was reasonably cheap. I want them to feel at home and I meant more in the sense that if they like a certain cartoon character or color they can pick that instead of having just neutral colors. The whole trip would work out to less than $200, maybe even less than $100 if we catch a good sale. Thanks for the advice though. I guess I will take your advice with regards to meals because I think if my wife and I were to let them choose their first couple of meals (which to be honest we were considering) that could turn into a problem if they wanted chicken nuggets and icecream every night for dinner. Now that we know who we're adopting, we've tailored the room to his interests/preferences etc. The quilt/sheets cost us a couple hundred dollars and we're buying toys and stuff for the room too. We're treating it as we would a new baby...they'd get all new things too.  \n",

She didn't even ask how she's doing. I think it's really important that you understand that children are reunified with sub-par (and even terrible and abusive) parents every day, sometimes because DCS made mistakes.

      "controllnmychaosI definitely feel medications are overused. And that the system of mental health and government relies to heavily on them. My nephew was in kindergarten when he had the heart episode. SIL, scared out of her mind of course, wanted to wean him off drugs all together. Thus ensued a lengthy battle between herself, the school, and all the doctors. Does he need the drugs, how much, yada yada. At one point the school threatened they weren't going to allow him in and then call CPS on her because he wasn't on the specific dose one particular doctor had prescribed. That's a nightmare I would rather avoid. greenmama, I really don't know why this is rubbing you in such a bad way. It's not like I'm suggesting locking a child in a room after they try to strangle the cat. There is a difference between issues and psychosis. I don't like the overuse of antibiotics either, but I'm not going to let one of my children suffer with an infection. I just try to avoid it if at all possible. I consider it neglectful to medicate a child rather than deal with the stress of their issues. Unfortunately, I think the medical and mental health fields have taken way to long to come to the same conclusion.A mental illness is not the same thing as stress. I'm annoyed because there are mental illnesses that can be treated without medication and there are some that are serious and life threatening and cannot be. To make a blanket statement that YOU wouldn't use medication to treat those illnesses is offensive.  \n",

I called my foster parents mom and dad, because I had no idea, that I didn't have to. So basically it up to the kid, who he think his mom and dad are.

I try to as much as I can but I also have 3 ruptured discs that took 2 years to resolve most of the pain. So I try to baby my back a bit. He let me use a mobi wrap when he was sick a while back but he has never let me use it other than when he was sick. I do think some of it is him wanting to be independent. I came across a video on his mom's facebook. The caption read \"I love him so much\", but in the video (he was about 8 months old) he'd crawl to her and then she'd cover his whole face with her hand and push on him, knocking him down onto the bed. He came to her 3 more times before he looked utterly defeated and gave up. So I sense that if that is her \"I love him\" video, then perhaps he got better affection and care from his dad. That is the saddest thing :-( I don't think it's normal for an 18 month old, but I think it's normal for a child with attachment issues. Feed him sweet things (and YOU do the feeding) and keep trying to give him lots of touch. If hugs aren't welcome, gentle pats and touches.

New SW that is wonderful, said she is sorry we missed the call last week for the baby as she was involved in getting in touch with us. She than said we are on the top of the list, to be patient, (with a smile). I was thinking of doing emergency placement & she asked if I would wait a few months, again we are on the top of the list, etc. She went on to say there is a pregnant mom that has already had 2 children taken from her at birth & placed but that family cannot take any more & that the baby will be placed immediately after she gives birth. Again, said we are on top of the list, & asked us if we would be open to this new baby keeping in contact with their siblings, of course we said YES!!!!! Did not want to ask her a ton of questions but I am truly hoping this means we are the ones that they will call for this baby when it is born :) My question is, do you think it would be ok to call this SW & just ask her a little more about the birth mom, when is she due, why are all her children being pulled immediately at birth, are we the potential family that will be called ( as she made it seem that way during the homestudy).

Our therapist has pretty much said that DD doesn't have the RAD diagnosis anymore, but she still comes every other week.

I can't wait until she gets out of the terrible twos so that I'll know if she's just exhibiting normal 2 year old behavior or something more. She's also drug exposed, so some of what we deal with might be that, it's too soon to tell. But she's attached, she's generally happy, and she's so sweet.

As far as what happens next, the parents can still attempt to work their plan-and Children's Division must still provide services to allow parents to work their plan unless the court has relieved them of services- at least here anyway.

It seems to me like they are running your around. If I remember from a previous post they also didn't want you speaking to the family...now I wonder if its because they have been told another story entirely. If it were me I would ask some point blank questions and get the answers directly from the horses mouth, so to speak. I would ask directly: has the family passed the homestudy? have you started ICPC? What is your (CW) recommendation as to placement? It's hard to be direct when we are afraid of the possible answers but it's better to find out sooner than later. In another post, she said that the caseworker said the baby would be moved if the family passed the home study.

      "MrsCCQ$400!?!?!? That is IT? We're certainly not \"in this for the money\" but by golly, that seems low considering Bubba's needs! Do you get that on top of his monthly care stipend that he would normally receive? In Virginia, all adoptive placements go through a VEMAT evaluation. You continue to receive their monthly base stipend, and then on top of that, they have a scale to which the children are rated based on needs, with corresponding dollar amounts to their need level. My girls have emotional and behavioral needs, as well as night terrors/bed wetting for my oldest, and those needs alone qualify them for nearly $1,000 a piece each month on top of their basic care stipend. But... I will still be driving them to and from therapy for a very long time, they are both on a few medications, my oldest has a sensory disorder and is ADHD. They both have terrible anxiety. My youngest, if not on anti-anxiety medication will tantrum daily. Although they are great girls in general, their anxiety and sensory disorder make it virtually impossible now to take them to the store etc. Both of them recognize they can't take it and they will now just ask to stay home with my husband if I offer to take them shopping. So $400 just sounds incredibly low. Once again, not about the money, because Lord knows every penny we get for our girls gets poured right back into them and gives them an amazing life.

      "JLMomYou HAVE to spend $50 a month on clothing? I wouldn't have the storage space to keep all the clothes. I'm swimming in clothes already & its just from all that the relatives buy (mine & the bios). I love hand-me downs, but I guess since my bio son is 7 months younger than fs, he's getting the clothes second. Anyway, nothing new to add to the thread, I was just shocked. Since I had kids, I don't spend $50 a month on MY clothes. Haven't bought anything beyond a package of socks for me since I quit work last fall to be stay-at-home to the 2 babies when we got fs. I think this depends where you shop. I spend a lot of money on my kids' clothes and a winter coat alone would be at least 2 months of a $50 stipend (if we got one).  \n",
      "boulsai11thx for the reply! it makes me feel alot better about what i did :flower: A pogo is a hotdog on a stick with batter around.Not very healthy to eat often, as a on the go meal for the week-end (acceptable)Iam just afraid CW will be upset that i refused Cereal for breakfast. And stuck to my gun with the choices i offered.(he had cereal the morning prior)Ill tell CS my plan (offer more then 1 choice and stick to it, if he refuses then he can pass until nexted snack or meal time)I hope she agrees.But i dont have the heart to let him eat all the junk food he wants, while my kids have to eat fruits/veggies/dairies all day (they have 1 treat per day if they ate good thru the day) And i dont have time to make 2-3 different meals every time eitherAt my house my kids have to at least try what I cook (I never make things I know they won't like) and then they can have a bowl of cereal. I even let them have cereal for dinner if that is what it takes. I refuse to battle over food...it's not worth it. There are much worse things, and bigger issues, that having cereal. I wouldn't fight this battle personally.  \n",

She said to put a little drop on my finger and put it on his tongue and told him he would get tabasco if he didn't stop the screaming and spitting. At first I thought it was cruel, but I was desperate. It worked like a charm! I only had to use it twice, and he took his timeouts quietly after that. I couldn't believe it. I'll probably get a rash of poop for sharing this, but it worked terrific and it was suggested by his therapist. Hey, it is a food product after all... Here that is considered child abuse and the kids would be taken away. I don't recommend this.  \n",

She literally was not allowed information at the doctor, couldn't enforce rules...it was insane. I know her books aren't in US and they are from 20ish years ago...but has ANYONE encountered this kind of secrecy when it comes to foster care?

      "UTbrieI am HIGHLY suspicious that being single is the ONLY reason that I am not getting ANY foster placements. (and that means not even a call for a potential Foster child, nevertheless actual placement). I think me working full time has a part in it. But I work in the medical world, have a large and supportive network of friends and family nearby and I volunteer with kids. I have worked at an MR/DD group home for 3 years in college. I have a LOT to offer....yet I have NO calls what so ever....??? A little over 4 months, and nothing. And my agency gets the harder kids, so I doubt it is the lack of kids. My age range is 0-11, so not too limited either. Meanwhile, a fellow FP, married and SAHM has 2 placements, and just adopted one of her fosters. I agree wholeheartedly with Sadoyle, there is an unspoken bias. In your case it might be because of the quickly disrupted placement you had initially...not really fair, but a possible issue.  \n",

So I guess I can see where that woman was coming from. I'm sure she is dealing with a lot of applications now during this economy.

      "potentialsinglemomI believe the only thing we can not sign in my state is surgery and/or general anethesia, otherwise, we have control of the medical care of our children. That just floors my sister, because when she was fostering her two sons, this was the process to TAKE the child to the dr: 1) child gets sick, call the cw 2) leave a message on the cw's voice mail 3) cw calls back you, tell him/her child's symptom(s) 4) cw might come to home to see if child is sick enough to go to the dr and the CW will make the appointment. 5) YOU take the child to the dr and describe symptoms, but the doctor does not tell you ANYTHING. He will prescribe meds thru the pharmacy and call in the lab tests. 6) YOU have to call the CW to get the Dr's verdict on what is wrong with child or test result AND cw are not obligated to tell you. Here we get medicaid cards monthly. Where she fostered they got nothing. If you take the child to the emergency room (unless the child is bleeding or stopped breathing) or to a Dr without cw approval, then YOU foot the bill. I don't think FP should be able to make medical decisions, but THAT procedure is ridiculous!!  \n",

      "I am wondering how some of the cases have gone for those of you who have adopted or are now the legal guardians for relatives? I am uncertain if this is where our case is going, but it has been brought up a few times and from what I see I wouldn't be shocked. My questions to you all, is what is it like after all the 'chaos' is gone? Are you able to live like a normal family? I have a VERY VERY big concern my older sister (BM) and BF are going to do pretty much whatever they have to to remain in the picture, but I cannot and will not have that 'poison' in my life. How are some of your experiences, do bios still try to butt in? How are the children, our are 4 & 6, both are at a point where they don't remember their parents being that bad, they acutally are saying their bio parents were great, but telling stories of stuff we have done. They are being told negative things by bios. I am 1. afraid they will believe them in the long run and resent us 2. very concerned they will be like their parents, which is SCARY. Any insight would be appreciated. I want to make an informed decision if it comes to it. As much as I love my niece and nephew though there are MANY MANY concerns I have if it does become permanent and I want a family of my own, and I want as normal a life as I can have with a family, but I'm concerned what that means...  \n",
      "That's amazing! I wonder what the motivation would be for a couple in their 20's to have so many foster/adopted kids? My heroes!  \n",
      "We did not plan on doing fostering, but my niece and nephew were placed with us through kinship care and we never once were asked for anything. We do have a house in a good city, but we are young and they have no idea what our situation is financially. One evening when our sw stopped by and she saw the kids each had their own rooms, and saw some clothes and told us it was so nice ALL the stuff we were providing (when I didn't feel it was even that much), but that we really needed to just give them the bare bare minimum... i couldn't believe my ears. She said she has gone to apartments that had three beds in one room and kids who only had one or two outfits. It just seems sad to me that people would use money they are given for things other than whats best for the kids, or that they would take on so much that maybe they couldn't provide a bit better for less kids. Granted the kids may be in a better situation overall...Overall I was just very surprised the sw would even say this and so I don't think it takes much. At least not from what I have seen.  \n",
      "Hi everyone, It's been awhile since the last time I was on here, but I was hoping maybe you could all give me some advice or pointers. A little back ground. For about a year and a half my niece (8) and nephew (5) lived with me after their mom had some issues with mental disorder (schizoaffective) and was unable to care for them. They went home to live with her just over a year ago. We continue to have them every other weekend and are very involved in school etc. My question for you all...Over the last few months I have noticed some of my sisters old tendencies coming back of when she first became diagnosed with schizoaffective. The last week or two have been very apparent. I am not sure if she is off her meds or what the situation is, but I don't believe she is honest when I ask and get VERY defensive. The CPS case is closed and has been for some time. I am curious if I should maybe make a report or contact the children's old attorney over some concerns lately. For example my sister is posting very bizzare posts on FB (not knowing I can see them) zombies eating people, God telling people to kill people, people who have committed mass murders and numerous things on rape. They are all being posted at 1, 2, 3 in morning. This is very similar to what began happen when we got the kids the first time. Another concern was when I picked up the kids this past weekend they had not eaten, I was told by my niece mom had no food. When we got back to their house I asked and my sister would not let me in but says she went shopping. My nephew who is 5 has told both me and my hubby that mom is keeping them inside with all the windows and blinds shut unless they are going to/from school. My niece who is 8 said to my hubby that mom has been just sleeping when they get home from school and she has to make dinner many evenings. The big one was when I stopped by to drop off my niece a week ago my niece ran up and just opened the door to go inside, all the way from the car I could hear my sister inside screaming at the top of her lungs, when the door opened she was in my nephews face (5) screaming and pointing her finger and he was standing there butt naked. There was stuff everywhere to the point you could hardly walk in the home. Again, I don't want to over react and start calling CPS but everything seems a little too familiar. What would you all do? I was considering contacting the kids old lawyer to see if she had any advice. I know FB posts aren't a big thing but when it's about starving children and rape and killing because god said so I would hate to just ignore it. Please help.  \n",
      "Hey Everyone. It's been awhile since I have been on here. Things have been going as well as can be expected since my niece and nephew have returned home. We have them for an evening about every other weekend and it seems to be working out! Recently however, things have seemed a bit off. I have started receiving the late night phone call (twice now) from my sister saying kinda random stuff. Then the few times I have called to talk with the children my niece (7) has been crying and my sister is saying things to her like she is a liar, she doesn't want to see or deal with her, all while I am on the phone. My niece in her recent visit with me begged to come back 'home' with me and I explained she couldn't and her mom loves her very much too and she can always come visit. The kids looked not great at the visit, exhausted, whiny, nails were very long and dirty, but nothing to extreme. Then last night I get a call from my sister that I needed to pick them up because she was having a heart attack. I said I could not and she'd have to call someone else (hardest thing ever but anyone who has followed my story knows it's for the best) she then called and said she left them at a neighbors house (she lives in a community for the mentally ill). I said okay, asked for their name and address and left it at that. At 1am I receive a phone call that my sister simply had a panic attack and everything was great! It all was very odd... With all that said I am curious, would you guys call GAL? I do not know the new CW and I don't want to make a huge deal, but from past this is definitely what my sister does when she is off her meds and I am a bit concerned. She still has an open CPS case against her, but she has said it's been quite awhile since anyone has stopped in. The last few months had seemed like things were better than what I had expected for the kids going home. Not great by any means, but ok. Now I am concerned. Thoughts? Hope you all are doing well!  \n",
      "Just horrible, absolutely horrible....My thoughts are with everyone affected...this truly is the lowest of the low...Makes you wanna just hug your kiddos and not let them go... :-(  \n",
      "Maybe I am just fighting a loosing battle at this point, but I can't seem to give it up...looking for any type of advice.... My niece has been RU'd for nearly a month at this point, case is still open, but they are back with bio mom and bio dad visits them a few days a week. Nearly every night my niece (7 y.o.) has been calling in tears begging for me to come get her...I don't think there is anything major going on besides mom just completely ignoring her (due to her 'mental illness') but it is HORRIBLE to keep getting these phone calls, especially since this is not like my niece at all.... I know nothing can probably be done about this, but is there any way to fight that RU was not good for the children's state of mind...I feel like my niece is like depressed or something and I don't know what I can do...just sit back and watch? Any ideas, any advice...they will visit, but I can't just pick them up every weekend because they want to be 'home' they were RU'd. I'm really torn and it's all I can think about...I got her a teddy that has my voice, made her a little scrap book, tell her constantly she is ok and she will be fine, but she just balls and balls on the phone... Please help.:hissy:  \n",
      "They live in a community for the 'mentally ill' and so there is this lady that oversees it, that is the one that threatned me last time I went over there, haha, real classy! Bio mom only has this place because it's free assuming she has the kids and this mental illness, also they give her a cell phone with minutes, bus pass, and I am sure more. The kids do still have their therapist once a week and I know my niece says stuff to them, but honestly I think there in conspiracy with CPS to make sure RU works as well... After a year and a half I hoped so much that something would be different, that RU could work, but now I am litterally to the point I want to forget them and the whole situation because it's killing me to watch this...and all I can assume is my sister is doing this because the kids get her more money...It's breaking my heart watching them suffer.  \n",
      "Thanks everyone for the input. I don't know that I will be bringing up that she can call CPS, honestly the kids know something is off about this whole situation, but I truly don't think they get they are 'foster children.' They just were staying with aunt and uncle and yes random people visited and a judge decided where they lived, but I always thought the more I could protect them from all of this the better....maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. I will however continue to encourage her to open up to her therapist and to make sure she is completely open and honest with the CW's when they check in to talk with her. What's hard is I know that I am the one she has always been open and honest with, ever since she was little we've had a 'mother - daughter type bond.' It always annoyed bio mom, but she never made any attempt at it. I spoke with bio mom last night about it, I of course got the answer I expected. 'She is fine until you call then she get's upset, also when she sees things that reminder her of you she get's upset, but otherwise she is a perfect happy kid. This is a greiving process that she'll have to learn to deal with on her own.' Ha! She doesn't know my 'Bean' at all and no kid should have to deal with this on her own...maybe it a grieving process, it prob. is, what is strange however is we didn't go through this process when mom left them at my house, as a matter of fact I would have to force her to even talk to bio mom when she called. Grrrrr. I could go on forever. I appreciate you all listening and giving feed back...I never ever in a million years thought I would be at this point...  \n",
      "Yeah ours never told us anything and we were a kinship placement. She's always say 'if you want to know go ask your sister.' Well, most of us know how that goes, I never got a straight answer... Frustrating to say the least. Good luck!  \n",
      "My niece and nephew left just about a month ago. I've got have them for an over night once since they've been gone and call them often on the phone. I just want to know does it ever get easier? I call my niece on the phone and the last few weeks she just starts crying, begging me to come get her...it truly is the WORST feeling in the world to tell her I can't, but I love her so much and I will see her soon. I know this is not my fault, but it doesn't matter it doesn't make the pain any better. I guess I would just love to know, does it ever get easier to handle with time? Is it the fact I still get to see them that makes it harder, would it be harder to not see them? I just wish I could make it better... Thanks for letting me vent... :-/  \n",
      "So I am struggling with this one and I want to make the best decision. My niece and nephew were RU'd about three weeks ago after a year and a half with us. We have had one overnight since they have returned and have been offered many more, so I'm not concerned about that. The kiddos have A LOT of stuff at our house, pretty spoiled, the bulk of the clothes went home with them and their favorite toys and stuffies, but a lot has stayed at our home per the request of bio mom (there place is very tiny) and because mom, past experience, is know to just throw stuff away or let it get damaged. Trust me before the kids were home I had bought a ton to help and they have NOT ONE thing left. Here is my dilemma...my nephew (4) has wanted a power wheels for some time now, Xmas was always when we discussed getting it, not realizing they would be RU'd at this point. I have NO issue getting him one and would LOVE to, his uncle especially wants to get him one. Bio mom and bio dad would never get something for him like this, maybe a few dollar tree type gifts. My issue is I would not want this to go back to bios house 1. because bio mom throws EVERYTHING away 2. she does not hold the kids accountable for taking care of their stuff 3. I don't trust she will watch him and their on a very busy road and 4. they have no where to put it. I don't want to be that 'parent' that buys great things and wont let them take it home, if I knew it would be cared for I would have no issue. On the other hand I know he would LOVE it and may have no issue with it staying. Their bikes and such are still at our house and they are totally good with that. With all that said, is it wrong to get him something like this given the situation? I truly want to do it for the right reasons and as he gets older and can take care of things he can absolutely have it....on the other side of this, what if it didn't come as a \"Christmas gift\" so it's not \"his\" but just a fun thing at our house. I'm torn, I would love to see the smile on his face, I live for that smile, but....  \n",
      "Thanks everyone kind of my thoughts as well...I am really considering getting it but not making it a Xmas gift as suggested, we have another niece as well who comes over on occasion to visit so maybe it's just a toy for them all to use when over...I don't want to outshine the parents, but well, the parents look to us to outshine them...seriously...they always push it off on us or tell the kids go ask your aunt and uncle we're poor...or not last year (because they were with us) but the year before that they told the kids there was no such thing as Xmas because you were baptized and people who were baptized don't celebrate it or they go to hell, yep I had to explain that to my upset 5 year old niece, and it was all just because the parents didn't feel like getting a tree or presents or here's an idea just make it a fun family day that doesn't cost money....horrible...and as HDMom says he's only little once....Uggghhh... thank you for the advice however I'm afraid you are all right!  \n",
      "Thanks everyone again! Great points you all make...I think I am going to wait and not do it for Xmas, but look at getting it after the holidays as many of you have suggested and not make it as much a gift as just a fun item at our house (this is not unusual for us to do). I am going to stick to buying them the usual Xmas gifts, which they can take home, if they choose...I mean realistically I'll spoil them rotten with that stuff as well, it's like I start and I can't stop finding stuff for them haha...that's what Xmas is about right? We're having the kids over the day before Xmas eve to spend the night and doing our Xmas day or Xmas eve morning!!!! We are going to be working on letters to Santa in the next couple of weeks to let him know that the kids will be doing Xmas at our house and at their parents! That way Santa isn't confused ;-) Thanks again!  \n",
      "In our area it was paid for. When my nephew lived with us he was considered a FC so he was moved to the top of the list, but that did not guarantee him a spot. A spot still had to become available. They finally after about 2 months offered a half day program because the full day was still full, that didn't work for us so we finally were able to get funding through our county for another daycare/pre-k school.  \n",
      "I believe even if someone else files, the IRS will audit you both and whoever proves they had the child for over 6 months (I believe that's the correct #) is able to claim the child. So I would think if you could provide placement paperwork or school enrollment or something you would get precedence. Could be wrong though. Good luck.  \n",
      "I saw this and I have to say my kiddos (niece & nephew) just got RU'd and I've considered fostering more even beyond my niece and nephew...He couldn't have said more exactly what was on my mind though. I get fostering and think it's such an amazing thing to give a kid a wonderful place to call home while going through a hard time, but gosh is it hard to say good bye, especially when you know the parents are still no better! So glad to see someone else saw this...I love that show! :-)  \n",
      "My niece and nephew got to come stay for an overnight last night!!!!!!!! It's been 3 grueling weeks only talking to them on the phone since we were doing the 'test' visit to make sure RU was the right thing and I finally got to see them, although I did talk with them every night.... They were wonderful for us, clicked right back into the groove of everything...it just felt so right, like my family was back. It was so hard having to drop them off today...my niece said she 'doesn't like being the poor family, walking everywhere' at one point during the stay I assured her sooo many people do this and she shouldn't be ashamed of who she is, she's a wonderful person and I am ALWAYS and will ALWAYS be here, and my home is always gonna be hers...She still has her room and nothing has changed at my house. My nephew as well wished he could stay said he has 'no homes.' I assured him as well and said that he was lucky because we would love for him to stay here but he has sooo many people that love him including his parents and they want him at their home too! We got to see their new 'home' to, it was hard, not what I would want my kids to grow up in, and well they are my kids now and I have to accept it. Got to meet some neighbors (they are in a mental health complex), pretty sure one threatned us, haha, but made it out safe! It was hard to say goodbye, so hard...but I know we had a great weekend and I'm counting down the days to the next.  \n",
      "Reunification was made official by the judge yesterday for my niece and nephew. They were doing a two week trial visit that led right up to the court date and then it was all made official. My kiddos have been gone for two weeks and I stayed strong and knew I couldn't see them during the trial visit...I was able to talk to them each evening however. So after the kids were officially RU'd I rec'd a call from the kiddos lawyer simply letting me know what happened at court and the official outcome and said and she was so glad to hear we had already planned a visit for this coming weekend. I said excuse me? She said yes that's what the CW and bio's said. I was very surprised. Now between me and all of you I was really hoping the kids would come over this weekend, it's been two weeks and I miss them like CRAZY!!!! I just wanted to see them, but hadn't discussed that with any one but my spouse. So I was a bit annoyed and shocked that this was supposedly planned and I was not at all involved.This evening I get a call from bio dad, saying his cell # was changed again (which is like the 5th number in 6 months, weird) and he wanted to firm up the visitation plans for this weekend....AM I CRAZY PEOPLE!? I DID NOT PLAN THIS...now my spouse is saying we shouldn't take them, but I feel like I am punishing the kids because they ask to come home to visit every time I chat with them and I hate saying I'm not sure when that will be. Plus I just want to hug on them and never let them go....... Uggghhh..Sorry for the vent....I just don't understand why if you are already pawning your kids off did you take them in the first place? Because I want them every moment!  \n",
      "Thank you all for the responses, I don't plan and definitely don't want to cancel this visit!!! I want to see them sooo badly...but I am thinking I will maybe pick them up later in the afternoon tomm and bring them home early sunday...that way I get to see them, but it's not offering too much of a break for bios. There is no intention of the parents coming over, just the kids, the parents basically are pawning them off (they don't want a relationship with us beyond being cordial for the kids, and that's fine by me), especially because it's been raining A LOT and this was and has always been when my sister goes 'crazy' She can't take them to the park for 5 hours and sit there while they entertain themselves, and it doesn't help they are in a MUCH smaller place then even before all this began so I am sure it's chaos. I guess what is hard for me is even before I had the kids for the last year and a half I had them every weekend for a year as well. And yes, obviously it was my choice, but it didn't help my sister would call and say she was freaking out come get them or that she would have my niece call and beg to come over. And well...it seems like we're headed right back down that path. At this point I have to be strong and say no, but it SUCKS because I would take my kiddos every day if it was up to me...They already before RU occurred offered for us to take them EVERY weekend, c'mon people thats not normal!!! As for trying to say anything to the bios at all, nothing goes through their heads, they just don't care. Trust me...we've had plenty of words and it just doesn't matter to them...they still have no problem calling...but only when they need something. It's like there is a complete block when it comes to anyone but themselves.  \n",
      "I am grateful for my wonderful boyfriend that has stuck by my side this last year and a half with all we have been through. I am thankful for my friends and family. I am thankful to have a roof over my head and food in the cupboard.But most of all I am thankful to get to care for my niece and nephew for the last year and a half. They have brought so much joy to my life, even in the rough times. They have taught me the joys of parenthood, but most of all they have taught me that you have to enjoy and be in every moment when it is happening. That you can't say I love you too much. They have taught me that I can't fix everything...Happy Thanksgiving to you all and yes thank you for all being here and understanding... :-)  \n",
      "It's been two days since my niece and nephew returned to do a two week trial with their mom that will probably lead right up to RU. Letting them leave was truly the hardest thing I have ever had to do...My niece was begging me to stay and there was nothing I could do about it...I got them each a teddy with mine and their uncle's voice recorded on it and also made a scrap book of the 4 of us. I have talked to my niece both days since they've been gone, it's so good to hear her voice. But I'm not going to lie, it tough. She sounds good even talked about her new school, and a new friend. But then she keeps asking if I can just come see her and pick her up, she's ready to come home. What sucks is I really don't think I can see her for this 2+ week trial visit, but how do I tell her that. I feel like I am letting her down...What made it even harder is last night she started saying 'Mom brother is hitting me, mom, mom.' At first I just assumed she was talking to bio mom and so I was silent waiting, and she says are you there? I said 'me?' and she says yeah, I am being silly with you... Now this is not something she called me so I was a bit surprised... I guess all in all this just really freaking SUCKS!!! Every where I turn in the house it's them, everyone I talk to tells me how we should have the kids they were doing AMAZING with us and it's only a matter of time until my sister doesn't want to do it again....How do you accept this and move on? How do you just go from being a parent to not?  \n",
      "It sounds like we are living the same story! Ha! Too bad it isn't a fairy tale, right? I am so sorry for those poor boys. We are 2 days from our two week trial of having the kids go home and live with bio mom that leads right up to court where the judge is suppose to say yes to RU. I have heard nothing about them going home in 2 days beside one e-mail from the CW about a week ago, is this typical to have nothing planned? This past weekend my kiddos went with bio mom from friday night to sunday, my nephew came home and was asleep from 6:30pm to 8:30 am the next day they were so exhausted, they reaked of smoke and the only thing they ate all weekend was mcdonalds and lunchables, my niece said bio mom has nothing in the fridge. Then on top of that niece mentioned they had a sleep over with the two neighbor girls because the neighbor girls mom was 'lazy', now let me remind you that my sister is in a complex for the 'mentally ill.' So it makes me wonder 2 things, what's in it for bio mom that she's babysitting? and can you babysit with an open CPS case? Then come to find out my niece mentions she has a new hobby with dad. He bring his mushroom book over and they go find mushrooms together. She is 7 mind you. I asked what they do once they find them, she said if they are the right small ones they pick them and put them in a baggy and he takes them back to his house? Now my thoughts, drugs? What if she eats one? What if my 4 year old nephew get's ahold of one and eats one? And finally..what the hell kind of hobby is this to have with a child?? So let's hope both are situations work out for the best intrest of both the kiddos.... Good luck again!  \n",
      "So I am sitting here trying to pack up stuff to send with my kiddos to go home for their 2 week trial, which may lead write up to them going home permanently (meaning they may not be back here to live after tomm.) Who would have known packing could be so hard, not because of anything to do with the actual packing, but pretty much because it makes me realize there is a good chance they're really leaving :-( Anyhow...I want to make sure I pack enough, but I also want to make sure I don't pack everything because there is a good chance they may come back and knowing bio mom (my sister) she won't return much if anything. I packed each kid 7 full days of clothes (meaning shirts, pants/shorts, underwear and socks) thick jacket, sweater, art supplies, books, stuffies and some other misc. I have asked the kids if there is anything special they would like to bring and they keep saying no. And bio mom called and said just send some clothes, she's not even having me drop them off she is instead sending bio dad to pick them up to take public transportation so they are a bit limited on what they can carry as well. She's busy so she can't make it...yes a bit beyond me! Anyhow assuming all goes well I figure I can then bring a fair amount of their other stuff over... Anything else you suggest I send/not send? Thanks...  \n",
      "So this is kind of the opposite of the typical posts on visitation schedules. Our kiddos after 15 months are suppose to return this week for their trial period and then officially be returned assuming it goes well... I of course have my doubts, and I am doing kinship so I know a lot more...But this weekend we dropped the kiddos off for their last weekend visitation before returning back to their bio mom, bio dad will be around but not actually living with them. Bio dad catches my ear as we drop them off and says he would like to sit down to come up with the visitation schedule for us to see the kids once they return...Now don't get me wrong I am so happy to be apart of their lives still because I know many of you don't get that...but to take the conversation one step further...he says I assume you will want them EVERY weekend. Really? I was just taken a back because if you want your kids back so bad why in the world are you willing to give them up EVERY weekend. They aren't even my kids and I HATE giving them up to their own bios every weekend. I honestly didn't even know what to say so I simply said good bye and got in the car...Not but 2 hours later that evening he called to give me the sob story about how he has no money and has to save every penny for when the kids go back this week, shouldn't he have considered this 15 months ago...he was telling me this because the kids wanted to go somewhere (that didn't even cost money) and he wanted me to come pick them up this weekend take them all day and drop them back off...I am so at a loss because we are already here and the kids haven't even officially gone home yet!!!! So what's gonna happen when it's 24/7 and they realize I can't take the kids every weekend, if we're going to do this, I have to just be aunt again because it's too hard...I'd love to be their parent, but right now I have to respect that I am not....Ughhh.And just to say bio mom is totally on board with bio dad's offers to me, she has even said the only reason she is taking them back at this point is because if she doesn't they will TPR her rights in the next couple of months.  \n",
      "CRAZY_WOMANThat very selfish. I'm not getting the big deal about them terminating her rights. Why would she even care, if she doesn't really want them? I think it has to do with the free apartment she has, free cell phone, welfare and food stamp checks and money that bio dad slips her every now and then. But maybe I am wrong...  \n",
      "@BoysParents - I am starting to realize and I 100% agree with everything everyone is saying. It's sometimes just hard to face the truth when there is 2 innocent kids involved...I could of written my sister off years ago, but unfortunately those kids always kept me coming back. I know that at this point if we want any sort of resolution it has to be done this way, for the sake of me and my life and for the sake of the kiddos. I do hope that if my sister's gonna do it she gives it 110%, but if she isn't I really hope she does what's best for the kids.... I wish you all the best in your RU this week as well. It does sounds a lot like our case that's how it started with us before CPS was even involved. Kids were just left on our step like we were babysitters and bio dad took full advantage and came and went as he pleased... I just wish I understood how you could look in the face of two kids, your own two kids in these situations and do this? I would have these kiddos everyday if I could and obviously I can't give them the world but believe me I get up everyday and try my darn hardest too. Like just this afternoon my DBF (devoted BF; one day hubby :-) picked the kids up early and sent me a photo, they were so happy, those are the moments I truly live for and as a parents I just don't get how you don't...  \n",
      "alys1If you're not going to see them -- which I concur is a good choice, if incredibly hard choice -- then can you phone them? So you don't disappear from their lives suddenly? So they have some continuity and support from you? I doubt at their ages that they have the ability to understand the concept that you will not be there part of the time. It could be a real lifesaver to not lose hope for them if you can talk to them. This is a great idea and something I have already disucssed with my niece. I always tell her she can call when she goes to visits, but I sometimes think she is afraid to ask, like she might hurt bios feelings if she wants to talk to us...So when we were laying in bed last night reading I asked her if she would like me to call her after she moves back and she was very excited and said yes! I asked her how often and she said well prob. every day in case I have something to tell you...So I said I would...I agree I don't think it will hurt for me to talk to them each day and let them know how much I love them and just see how their day is going. For this two week trial period I plan on not actually seeing them, but I will soon there after, I just have to keep it to a minimum, at least for awhile. I can't continue to enable their parents.... Today she asked if she will be coming over on Thanksgiving to go to Grandma's (my devoted BF's grandma that they call Grandma too) I then had to tell her prob. not because her parents will prob. want her to be home...I felt like I completely deflated her excitement :-( and I HATEEEEE that.  \n",
      "I am so sorry for you and especially these boys...I know the feeling and it's so frustrating. People figure this kind of stuff out everyday, and then these bios in our situations don't have their kids the bulk of the time and still can't figure it out...when is enough enough?  \n",
      "I never have personally had to deal with this, but I did toilet train my nephew and he was known to hold it as well. She is at an age that maybe you can start like she is new to toilet training....meaning lots of praise and maybe offering like a reward system, maybe even taking her to the store to get fun princess big girl underwear or something...I mean maybe she was just never really taught to use the bathroom...I am totally taking a wild guess, but at the age of 6 assuming it's not a medical issue maybe it just means starting from square one.Good luck to you both!  \n",
      "When you have a open CPS case against you are you allowed to have other children sleep over? My kiddos came home this weekend and said that the two neighbors kids stayed the night this weekend with bio mom. So it was just my two kiddos bio mom and the two neighbor kiddos. My niece said the bio mom of the neighbor girls was 'being lazy.' Now they live in a shelter type community, but it does have individual apartments for families. Just seemed interesting to me and I was curious, obviously not much I can do about it, and obviously the neighbor mother isn't completely either letting her two kids stay the night...  \n",
      "So my kiddos go home for their 2 week trial period next week...I'm completely torn up as are they. Obviously I hope for the kids sake that it all works out...but I guess my concern is there is a lot of signs pointing to the fact that there is a good chance it might not and that's what scares me more. I HATE more than anything knowing they are being uprooted again and might in the future. I guess what I was curious, obviously every situation is different and my situation may turn out to surprise me. But from what the CW has said, bio mom and family therapist, it's that mom's time is coming to an end and they are basically forcing the kids home before the next court date. She has three months until we hit 18 months which in CA can mean TPR and in our case it prob. would. Bio mom (my sister) has said she 'has to do this because they will TPR me if I don't' Which says to me she's not doing it because she wants to but because she has to...Nothing in her life is different. She does have a small place, but other than that I truly feel she is only taking them back because that is how she gets to keep her place, and will get money from the government as well as the bio dad for the kids. I mean with that said, obviosuly there is more, I am just looking what some experiences have been with RU. Have you had a bio that really prob. wasn't ready, but really pulled it together and still has their kids as far as you know or in most cases has it only been a matter of time? The CW is recommending after the 2 week period the kids be returned, how often does a judge decide different? Especially so close to potentioal TPR? Again just curious of what I could potentioally be expecting. I guess I'm just looking for anything at this point... :-(  \n",
      "They are 7 & 4. Mom has been for the most part pretty compliant. She is my sister. It's not that I don't think she loves them, but at the end of the day I think she just likes to visit. She doesn't want to do the whole 'mom' thing. I mean in my opinion. I have had the kids for 15 months with CPS involved, but I have have had the kids for much more time than that....Bio mom has always wanted things handed to her, she doesn't want to work for ANYTHING....and if anything gets too tough she gives up...kids are typically the first to go...That's why it is so hard to believe this will work, and I hate uprooting the kids if that is just going to be the case again....She does show up for required visits, but other than that has showed absolutely zero interest in them or their lives, doesn't even call on their birthdays, holidays nothing...It just seems to me they aren't going home for the right reasons and that's what scares me. It just seems at this point they're being pushed home for the sake of court.  \n",
      "Mine are being returned over the holidays...It's been 15 months and they are choosing the holidays...It's horrible for them and for us, IMO. I feel bad we were just looking at all the toy ads that had come out the kids were picking things they wanted Santa to bring...we were told they'd be with us at least through Xmas and probably returned right there after...well things changed and they are going back next week. I feel horrible because Xmas is so different with bios, if at all.....And I know this first hand because I am related. Ugghh.. I HATE it!  \n",
      "Just found out that my kiddos are going home in a week for a 2.5 week trial period, that takes us to the next court date and assuming it goes well, they go back permanently. I knew this day may come but I am crushed...We were assured it wouldn't happen until at least near Xmas so I feel completed blindsided and horrible that we haven't done more to prepare them. :(  \n",
      "Thank you everyone, I talked to the kids yesterday, they didn't really seem to have any emotion to the idea, but I don't know that they really get it either so I'm not taking it personally. I do hope to be involved in their lives after this, but doesn't make it any easier knowing I don't get to see them everyday...plus I don't know how much the bio dad will let me be involved because he is just on a power trip. Although he isn't even the one getting the kids back.... @Tempmom I get what you are saying and I agree, they won't screw up that bad though, I just wish they would actually think about what's best for their kids...for once...but the fact of the matter is they get free housing and a free paycheck when the kids are with them...so who cares about the kids, right? @Sheena85 - they are 7 and 4, they moved in officially beginning of Aug. 2011, so about 15 months ago. They were with us every weekend for a year before that as well and had lived with us about 6 weeks total while mom and dad checked out before that.... Thanks again everyone...we'll see where this takes us...  \n",
      "@irq11 - great question I've always wondered the same thing... Things going okay with your little guy and the recent changes? Take care.  \n",
      "So recently my nephew has been actively exploring calling us mom and dad. It seems the more visits he's been going on the more he wants to come home and call us mom and dad. This evening he even proceeded to ask me if it's okay to call us it. He is 4 by the way and we have had him for 15 months and have known and been actively involved in his life since birth. I guess my question is I am not sure what to do? I have no issue what so ever with it. It's actually pretty cute and I feel like his mom. On the other hand he is my nephew and we are still trying for RU with bios. Also, I know my sister would flip if she caught wind of it. I guess I am confused, I know he is confused...what is the best way to proceed? I don't want to say NO you can't call me that, because I am like mom right now on the other hand I don't want to confuse him more especially if the goal is RU. To top it of my poor guy has not had a poop accident in months beyond months and tonight while with bio dad he pooped his pants. When I asked him why he didn't have anything to say except 'I dunno Mama'....uggghhhhhh  \n",
      "So we are on our 4th CW in our case. Each of the others went on 'vacation' and were only suppose to be gone a week or two, but then never came back and we were assigned new CW's each time. Well...it's happened again... Our current CW who we've had about 5 months called and said she was going to be out of the office on vacation for about 2 weeks and now we are going on 5. I was contacted recentlly by a CW from a different dept. who will be doing our monthly check in this month, but she knows nothing, in terms of our case or where our CW is or if/when she is coming back. It concerns me a bit because we are supposedly doing our 'way too long, IMO' transition home and we go back to court in 3 weeks to find out if the kids will move home permanently or not... from what I was told this month we were even going to do a 2 week visit right before/over Thanksgiving, but have heard nothing. It's kind of hard to plan anything not knowing what we're doing.... I have contacted a person higher up but have yet to hear back. Has anyone else gone through this? Is this typical of cases? Don't get me wrong I'm thrilled knowing my kiddos are still with me, but it's crazy not knowing ANYTHING when we are supposedly transitioning these kids back with their bios...  \n",
      "I like the point they make that \"if a stranger had beaten Jocelyn the same way, no one would hesitate to give that person life in prison.\" That is so true!!! Why would the mother of this poor child not deserve the same exact sentencing?? I think her being the mother, their protector means all the more she deserves it... It makes me sick to know there are people out there like this. I hope for nothing but the best for her poor children. The other part that stuck out to me way \"Escalona had asked afterward, \"What about my children?\"\" Really? Maybe she should of considered her children before she put one in a coma...  \n",
      "So my kiddos are about to head off to a visit. They are walking about a mile to a nearby park. It's extremely cold outside, drizzly and it's starting to get dark before they are home.... I HATE IT! I have brought it up numerous times to therapists, bios and CW's that the weather and time is changing, this isn't fair to the children! I feel bad because we can't take them to and from every visit (we work full time), and we refuse to have bios in our home anymore (we did that for over 9 months) and now I feel bad that the kids are the one paying the price and they're cold and walking. But to a degree i feel like this is going to be reality soon for them anyways. It's going to be cold and raining and they will have to walk/take buses to school, doctors appts., store, anywhere. These are the times I feel horrible for them (not that I don't always), they don't deserve this, but no one else seems to consider what's good for them...not even their own parents which is the most disgusting part. Grrrrrrr...why can't anyone else see that children don't deserve this kind of life. Whether they stay with me or not they don't deserve it!!!! :-(  \n",
      "@phxmama - Yes you said it much better than I did. At the end of the day it's not the fact they don't have a car or have to walk, I guess that it's the fact that I can't protect them and know that soon they will probably going back to two people I truly don't believe are better or ready to parent and it makes me sad. I care so much about my kiddos and want so much better for them, not even material wise, but even just parents that seem to care and show them and abundant amount of love and that may not be doing the best, but worked their butts of to try and do what's right and get their kids back. I wish they would just think about their kids for once... At this point we go back to court end of Nov. that will be 16 months. They are talking about RU over X-mas break, but even the CW is skeptical about it.  \n",
      "@irq11 - you are so right and I agree our situations sound very similar. I am also afraid you are right about RU, I do believe it will happen, but I to question how long it will last ...this time. I'm trying to take one day at a time and expect what happens gonna happen. I'm just scared if they go back, I am not going to be able to say yes again. I love them soooo much, but feel like if and when they do go back into care that A.) it will be a continual back and forth game for them for a VERY long time, which isn't fair B.) I don't know how much more my heart can take and C.) if they go back I know I'm gonna want my own , and that's because of how much I've enjoyed life with them, but I don't think I can put kids through all of this (CW's/therpaists/visits/having to have my kiddos bios around, court dates etc.)...it truly feels like my life is consumed by all of this at times and that in some respects doesn't feel right to bring kids of my own into, and I don't know if it feels this way because it's family or if this is normal but I wish for my kiddos sake it would all go away and they can just have a 'normal' day/week/month/year... for once.  \n",
      "My kids' parents do the same thing. I am so sorry you are having to do this, I hope it turns out better than everyone is thinking for his sake. Good luck.  \n",
      "We have the same situation with my niece and nephew and their parents. Bio mom has never had a license, bio dad got his back but then recently got his car towed for like 14 tickets, so I would have to believe they prob took his licesense or suspended it as well. Needless to say we started unsupervised visits and the CW indicated bios are given free public transportation tickets to and from visits for themselves and the children. Bio dad did recently show up with a random car, I had been told ahead of time by niece that this may happen, so I asked the CW what to do in case. Basically she said tell the bios to call her if they had an issue but the kids were not to go in the car. If they take them in the car you call her and if necessary the police. Needless to say he did show up with the car and it worked out fine, the kids and them walked. CW said for future she has to verify license, insurance and registration, if she can't do that then no car. Our CW said basically she'll call if the car does become an option in the future otherwise for now assume it's not and if bios have an issue with that put it back on her. Oh also I did all this communication by e-mail....in case I need to make a police report or something. I do ALWAYS casually ask the kids about whether or not they got in a car at a visit, yours may be too young, but for us it's so far so good, thank goodness! Good luck!  \n",
      "I am so happy for you guys!!! Congrats!!! I hope everything is smooth sailing from here ;-)  \n",
      "I would maybe start a photo album or put the stuff in a box as others suggested. As for the toys, once the kids started doing visits and overnights I sent back the toys they had got the kids. It wasn't much and it was all pretty much dollar store items, but at least they had something over there and I didn't have to deal with it. I also kindly asked them to keep stuff they get the kids at their home now as they have plenty of stuff to keep them busy when they're with us. On the other side I guess it's good your niece is at least getting stuff, our bios (my sister and bio dad) haven't got my niece and nephew hardly anything in the last 15 months, it's actually quite sad.  \n",
      "I didn't read through all the posts, but I agree it sounds like something is not adding up. Maybe bio mom is expressing she is not ready or does not want to do it at this time...or maybe there is something else they are not disclosing. I know in my sister's case I also feel like why do we keep putting RU off...but honestly I am wondering if they are waiting to see if she fails, or if there is something they're withholding in our case as well...Even as a sister I feel I am kept pretty in the dark about things. Good Luck.  \n",
      "Is there a therapist or someone you can talk to? I have brought this up with our GAL for our little guy as well. We haven't had any major issue, but are going towards RU and my little man has been with me a good part of his life so I want to be prepared if it's not going well. Our GAL said that if his behavior or moods start changing drastically for the worst basically they will have his therapist evaluate him to see if RU is detrimental to his health and they can TPR on that. Now I'm not sure they really would ever really care enough to do this if the parents are showing interest, at least in my experience, but it was what I was told. Good Luck to all of you.  \n",
      "My nephew did the same exact thing at this age. I honestly thought we'd never get him to stop crying. Now he is 4.5 and he's awesome!! We still do have our moments, and they tend to be worse after visits (bio mom still treats him like her 'baby'). For us it was honestly just a phase we had to deal with...We knew for him, as you are saying, it seemed mostly for attention or to get his way, we worked really hard at not giving in. If he seemed to be crying just because, we simply would asked him nicely to use his big boy words and that we could talk once he was done crying. We would wait a couple of minutes for him to be fully done then we would address what he was asking for...If it was crying because he didn't get his way we learned no matter what we couldn't give in. Good luck and I hope it's just a phase for you guys as well!!!  \n",
      "Is this normal for a 7 year old? So my niece has some unusual quirks about her, I love her to death, but she can drive me ragged, and tonight was one of those nights....Any thoughts? She is unusually smart, but lacks extremely in the common sense department which I know can be common for smart people. My question is, she always has to be exactly right about something, nothing can be broad. For example, you say look at that car...her response, 'that's not a car it's a truck.' I know it doesn't sounds like a big deal, but she does it about EVERYTHING!!!! And on top of this she debates everything and is so unappreciative of everything...I don't think I have genuinely ever seen her happy, nothing ever seems good enough. We've talked numerous times about the way she's acting and different ways of acting. We don't ever give in to the debating... The thing about all of it is I genuinely think she just doesn't get it. I'm not sure she even realizes she's doing it, I think it's just how her brain is wired. I have brought it up to the therapist time and time again, but they seem completely unconcerned about it. But it's driving me CRAZY!!!! And on top of this she has very very bad anxiety, but once again therapist says here's some breathing techniques and that should solve the problem...but it doesn't!!! Am I over thinking this? Is this just normal at this age?  \n",
      "This is more or less a vent and to see if any of you have ideas on how I can handle... My niece is being completely manipulated by her parents and it's completely breaking my heart, but no one seems to care or choose to see it. Frankly I think they've all played in to the bio father's poor me manipulation as well. This weekend kids go for their first full weekend stay (two nights). Kids are under the impression they will be living with both mom and dad but that's not the case, I've tried to explain, but bios are convincing them of something completely different. Anyhow, one of MANY examples, niece comes home from visit and says they went on an 'excursion' it was fun but they shouldn't have done it, it cost way too much money. She's 7 and constantly worried about her parents and money, so sad. Later she asks if she can bring her allowance next week to the visit for mom and dad...I say that's very nice, but that's money she earned and I'd like to see her do something nice for herself. It's her mom and dad's job to worry about money, not hers. I was confused why this all came up. Then the real story came out. Neither kid wants to be with mom and bio dad did the typical I'll be there when it's convienent. Well after their fun excursion out my niece wanted him to come back to tuck her in (he is allowed at bio moms house and is there quite often, they're \"together\" still) bio dad says 'nope sorry I can't afford public transportation because you guys spent all the money on the excursion.' My niece said she cried and cried. All of this is false, bios get free public transportation passes, afford their ciggarettes, constant eating out. But I'll be ****ed if he keeps breaking her heart like this, it's killing me. What kills me most is that her dad is her world and one day she's gonna have to see what a manipulative miserable human being he is... Any suggestions when this kind of stuff keeps happening? The CW/therapists just aren't listening. Last week he even told her he got a cat (that is like her biggest dream) well he didn't, it's like a neighborhood cat that he gets her excited about... Grrrrr............ Oh and bio mom took kids to Target to go 'play' my nephew found a box of open cheez itz, instead of explaining like a mother we don't touch those, they aren't ours, we don't know whose touched them or why they're open. She tells him someone put poison inside the box and it will kill him. Yep, he's 4! Super MOM!!!!  \n",
      "So as you all know our case is just getting dragged on and on. At this point we are at 15 months and doing pretty much a 50/50 joint custody thing with bios, who don't have our same rules at all!!! We get to be the 'parents' and they get the fun time....makes no sense in our opinions. Is it because we're related no one seems to care if these kids have permanency? We know we have to continue doing this until at least Xmas time...then we'll see where the case stands so that puts us at 17 months, and we are still in full RU mode. My questions is, would it be wrong of us to put a time limit on our case for our sake? I honestly am feeling like at this point this could go on forever! I HATE even considering this, but it's unfair to all of us. I am ready to move on and have kids of my own, and I don't feel I can do that with this whole 'situation' going on. Plus I'm not sure how much longer I can base my life around visits, bios that suck, pick ups, drop offs and constantly feeling like the bad guy!!! When is it time??? Uggghh.  \n",
      "We have to continue doing this until at least Xmas because they feel this is going to be a good time to transition the kids home because it's a long break with school and then after break they can start up at their new school. They do have unsupervised visits now, basically it's a few hours wends and thursday at a park with bios and now full weekends. But the CW is still unsure if they will even go back by Xmas because mom still had 'more stuff to get.' The place is a 1 bed, how much more could she possibly have to get??? It seems just like excuses at this point.... Grrrrr... this is the longest RU plan ever... and it sucks being a 50/50 joint parent with people who don't care about anything when it coems to their kids.  \n",
      "Don't feel bad, I know it's hard not too, but you made the right decision for yourseleves I am sure. We are doing kinship and I feel the same way about the bios (my older half sister) we've said that if our kiddos end up going back and then going back into the care of the county we are not sure we'd reopen our home, granted our case is on 14 months at this point and in our opinion is completely getting dragged. But as I repeat over and over it's not the kids that are my issue it's the bios and all the drama and visits that are. Good luck and I hope it all works out for the best.  \n",
      "So for the last 3 weeks we've been passing a cold around the house, we've all had it at this point. It was rough, but we all made it through. This last weekend our kiddos had their first overnight visit (that's another story) but needless to say we have got phone calls from both bios at this point indicating all visits are off this week because they have 'the cold,' because we didn't mention the kids had, had it??? What confuses me is we had the joy of being sick and still taking care of the kids, why do they get the 'get out of taking care of our kids or seeing for that matter' card when they're sick??? Does this make any sense? And you think your capable of caring for them?  \n",
      "Tonight my niece and nephew had their first overnight... They were ecstatic, and I do truly hope it's as great as their hoping for. But then on the way to drop them off my nephew says 'yeah I am spending the night at mom's and I never see you again!' I said that's not nice you want to see me again and he said 'nope I don't never again.' I know he's little and maybe he doesn't know better, but I can't help question why I've given up over a year...my heart broke a little tonight :-(  \n",
      "So we are in the process of transitioning the kids home, although it's like a 4 month process (not exagerating) and may possible be longer according to the CW. I am starting to feel like my niece and nephews babysitter or full time nanny however. Not from them, but from everyone else. We are up to visits 4 days a week. A few hours each time and one overnight starting any week now. What stinks is we work full time, except weekends and aren't home until 5pm on week days. At this point we get two evening a week to hang out with our kiddos and that's it. Other than that we basically are the home that gives them showers, food, a bed and takes them to school/dr. appts. The parents are TRYING to make it so we have to work around their schedule for half the visits, which the CW is basically saying the bios and I need to agree on a time. The kids are hating the schedule and it even went as far as them saying they wished we were their parents the other day... I feel so bad and I'm frustrated. How do you keep doing this for an extended period of time. We can't make any definitive plans for weekends or go anywhere because we have to simply make sure were there when the kids come home from visits and make it to visits. Yet the issue I have is we get to be the 'parents' but don't get any of the parent perks or hang out time :-( So my question to you is how do you all handle this for an extended period of time like this?  \n",
      "@BoysParent - I think to a degree I do with they were staying with me forever, or at least going back to a good home with good people that love them...to know what they are going back to kills me. Also, I can't lie they've really been testing calling us 'mom' and 'dad' lately and it's nice to hear....they're great kids and deserve so much better and it sucks that their parents won't try at all for that. @Ians Mom - I did say that; they threatened to have them removed if I couldn't support RU. I think it's worse to keep the kids in limbo, and frankly they are already seeing what they may go back to and totally freaking out about it. Why do this to them? They also are thinking that transitioning them over Xmas break would be better because my niece will have to change school districts. It makes me so sad to know that Xmas is suppose to be such a happy time and they will be going 'home' to a place where there mom and dad more than likely won't even have it because that means they may have to spend money on them (and yes this has happened on all of their Xmases, except last year with us).  \n",
      "So I feel like I am constantly getting asked how things are going with the kids by the one on one therapist, family therapist, CW and GAL, and I tell them truthfully what I see and notice... Then I get told I need to connect with bio mom (my sister) to tell her how things are going with the kids. But I do that and it gets thrown back in my face, plus she never EVER takes the time to ask about the kids or what they've been up to or how they are doing or how I am doing for that matter...I can honestly look her in the face say hello how are you and get a blank stare like I'm talking to a wall. I guess I am just feeling like this just keeps getting dragged on and on, we are going on month 17 here and the goal is still 100% RU. It's sickening because the kids truly don't want to go back, especially not with bio mom, like they can't stand her. Bio dad they do have fun with, he's like a big kid, good father? well that's another story. But at what point do you just respond with 'Everything is fine' when asked and let things take it's course. I point out things like major major meltdowns, pants wetting, things that are said but they get totally ignored, misconstrued or it's ran straight to the bios and then they get upset. But really all I'm doing is giving it how I am seeing it, they can take it or leave it. But at some point I feel like does what i say even matter or is it just pissing people off and dragging things on? **Vent over** :-)  \n",
      "I completely agree with each of you and I am 'glad' that I am not in this boat alone. @URmysunshine4 - it sounds like we have the same CW :-). It's just so sad to see what these kids go through and it prob. doesn't help I am doing kinship and know WAY more than I prob. want to. The other day my nephew came home from a visit and he grabbed right on to me 'he said don't let me go I stay with you forever and ever, and dad.' I said dad? and he pointed to his uncle and ran over and grabbed him.... you feel soooo bad!!! I told him if it was my choice I would keep him forever and longer. Then after their first all day visit he had a major beyond normal tantrum, I reported it when they asked how it went, then it got back to bios and of course I got the e-mail saying 'it's because they want to be back with their MOTHER AND FATHER.' And that is exactly why i feel like i should keep my mouth shut. Because it doesn't matter what the kids want or what is best, it's about the parents...What just sucks is my kiddos will go back and be right back in the system (I hope it doesn't happen) but there is nothing in my mind that has even remotely convinced me my sister is capable or even wants to do this, except maybe because she gets a free apt. and more money from the state. Grrrrrrr....I could cry it's so frustrating...it's just unfair...no kid deserves this, even the CW this week said she still has a lot of reservations and our home seems amazing for them, but since bio mom worked her case plan they kids will go back...I don't know but it seems to me they need to come up with a bit more realistic case plan.  \n",
      "No Way!!! I am so sorry for you guys. That's kind of how it is in our case. I thought bio dad would put up fight and bio mom would just walk away, but we've been surprised...it's interesting how it seems like they just seem to get on this power trip, in our case it has personally made me question whether it's because they truly love and want their kids back or just to make a point and make everyone else miserable. Good luck!!!!!  \n",
      "So most of you know that we do kinship care in CA which I know is a bit different from typical fostering. This week our CW stopped by and we were discussing if my kiddos are RU'd is there any steps we should take if they were removed again. (I really don't want them to be taken and moved to a temporary home/shelter, I would just want them to come straight back home). I don't know if we would be a permanent home for them at that point, but I know at the very least we would be somewhere safe they could stay until they found the right family (but lets be real they'd prob. just stay :-) Anyhow, the CW mentioned we may think about getting licensed so the kids could come straight back and we wouldn't have to go through everything all over again...She said they would probably come back if we agreed any way because we are kinship but we may have to go through hoops again so it could take some time... Does any one have experience with this or have a suggestions one way or another? Any thoughts or input would be greatly appreciated.  \n",
      "Thank you all for the replies, I think that is the right answer as well...I have wrote the CW to get more specifics we'll see where it goes and go from there.@irq11 - We do get a monthly stipend in CA and I think it's just as much as typical FP's. Also, we get day care paid for and medical. So it's very good in terms of that...As for the longer visits, we've only done two weekend day visits and starting overnights. The kids go back and forth, when they saw where they may be living they were very disappointed (it's much diff. from our place). Also they heard it wasn't going to be with both parents, they aren't super close with either but definitely not my sister (bio mom) and she will be the primary care giver, uh oh! I think it will be fun for a couple of weeks (even that is a far reach, IMO) but once they really start to understand they may be going back to live there I think they are gonna freak out. I feel so bad because just the other day we were at school and a classmate asked my niece is this your mom she looks so cool! Her response: Yep it is and she is really coolThen tonight my nephew came home from a visit and said I stay with Auntie...and dad. I said Dad? and he ran and grabbed his Uncle and said yeah this daddy. Who he recently started referring to as Uncle Daddy cause kids at day care to. Haha. We've always just gone by aunt and uncle, but it's very cute, can't lie.It really just SUCKS sometimes, I feel so bad for them...How is your 'situation' going? How is your little guy taking that there are no more visits? Are you guys gonna have to do the goodbye visit?  \n",
      "Momsalot Well, to make it up to him, you're gonna have to have an extra party cause one of them got skipped somewhere :eyebrows:  Poor guy, I wouldn't imagine it will be a good feeling for him to know he didn't even know his real age. But I like the idea above. Maybe do a party now to celebrate whichever one was forgotten! Make it really special for him...  \n",
      "I would check with the CW as well, but I know my niece and nephew after 13 months will be starting overnights and it is actually slightly shocking to me where they allow parents to call home, so a hotel room for overnights may be completely acceptable. Yes, their housing situation may not be up to my 'standards' and granted it's prob. better than some of the situations a lot of other's Foster Kiddos had to go back to, but still it's crazy to me. I was already dissapointed to hear it was in a not so great city, then was told it's a 'shelter' type apt. for mentally ill, but then it was talked up to the kiddos and come to find out it's no more than about 500 sq. ft. 1 bd. for 4 of them and 1 bed...the kids were in shock when they found out. I feel horrible for them.... Good luck and I hope everything works out for you all....  \n",
      "Wow, I am so sorry you all had to go through that, including the boy...But if i was in your shoes I would have done the same thing. I don't know how you deal with the guilt, but you can't feel guilty for needing to keep you and your family safe. Hopefully they will find a new place for the boy that can work better with his needs and help him more in the long run. It doesn't sound like he should have ever been placed with you in the first place and you can't blame yourself for that... Good luck with everything!  \n",
      "Yeahhhh!!!! I am so thrilled for you guys...I had been wondering what was going on!!! What a great day for you...I hope everything is as quick and painless as possible from here.  \n",
      "Welcome to the world of SW's :-)...no but in all seriousness I would follow up. I am sorry you are already having to deal with that...Hopefully she sees how excited and willing you guys are! Good luck!  \n",
      "I was just wondering how everyone else handles kids activities during bios visit time? We recently began full weekend day visits and it will quickly be turning to full weekend overnights. Kiddos were invited to an activity this weekend, so I didn't tell the kids (didn't want to get their hopes up), but instead told bio mom as soon as I found out, gave her full details since it's during her time. Her response was to ask them if they wanted to go or not so I did and they of course wanted to. All their buddies will be there and it's at a fun place for a couple of hours (out of the almost 10 the bios have them). I told the bios the kids said yes and now bios are saying 'well we have to reschedule the visit so you can take them.' ??? I simply responded it's their day with the kids, it's a couple of hours, if you choose to take them great if not that's up to them it's your time to be the parent. But I refused to reschedule, the only other option is to out right cancel IMO and I'd be more than happy to take them, but rescheduling over this is rediculous. So I am curious, how do you all handle kids activities during bio vistis? Tell bios and let them decide whether kids go or simply say nothing about it and move on???  \n",
      "c.aIsn't that the social worker's call? How old are the kids? What would be the SW's call? Whether or not they should go to the activity or should the CW be asked before the bios? They are 4/7.  \n",
      "MomInCorazonI would tell mom, give her the info and that's it. I wouldn't mention it to the kids (even if she asked do they want to go). You are right - it is her time to parent and that includes deciding if the kids are going to attend an event, party, etc. I absolutely would not reschedule over this. The kids will be disappointed if they don't get to go but that's on mom. And unfortunately with RU around the corner they'll be plenty more disappointment likely to come. Okay that's kind of my thoughts exactly. They would have found out whether I mentioned it or not as all the kiddos at school were chatting about it, but I was trying to keep it a bit under wraps in case something like this happened. I know there already is quite a few school events coming up that fall on their time and I'm afraid a lot of dissapointment may come along with that. :-( This 'job' sucks sometimes....  \n",
      "I'm so sorry for that little guy, must be so confusing I am hoping the system can figure it out this time before bouncing him back and forth.  \n",
      "So kiddos had first all day visit with bios (9 hours) this past weekend at bio moms new place . It seemed to go okay, I guess, but a few things the kids mentioned seemed odd and I'm not sure if I should mention or just see how future visits play out. 1. I told bio mom kids' approx. eating/snack times - when they got home (after dinner) they were STARVING, said all day only ate one hot dog and some chips. 2. Bio mom has been telling them all about their 'new room' but when kids got there it turns out it's a 1 bed 600 sq. ft. place and the room is setup as hers. She told kids they'll share it when we start over nights in a few weeks and she'll sleep on the couch. They also were SHOCKED to find no TV or toys/books. (toys/books were told they would come later) Now first off would they really let the kids move back to a one bedroom, its a 7yo girl and 4 yo boy and supposedly both parents? Second should I mention anything or let it go for now...I mean I did my part in giving her the eating timelines. Not to mention kids came home pretty much silent, which is very unusual and my little 4yo had the worst tantrum we've ever experienced last night (18 hours after returning from visit) kicking, puching, screaming pretty much just going ballistic, although the first part of the day was good with him. He was asked to play a different game (him and sister were not getting along) which I new he wouldn't like but not to that degree... It was insane to say the least. Any thoughts or suggestions?  \n",
      "I understand all of your points and I think you have all made very good and valid ones... I think in my case I am going to let it play out a bit more and see how it goes, prepare the kids a big breakfast and make sure dinner is on the table when they get home. I am a bit concerned because we are starting overnights in a few weeks. @arbuckle17 - I do agree with your points. At this point it's been over a year and I have provided ALL snacks/lunches/dinners for the couple hour visits. I also have passed along our schedule and what the kids like to eat. I think I am going to let it play out in terms of how she proceeds to handle things...maybe it's not the right tactic and I may have to change, but it's been too long and she's got to do it at this point and if she can't well I think that needs to be seen, whether that leads to more help for her after RU or no RU remains to be seen.  \n",
      "arbuckle17Understood Life, in the end you are going to be the best judge of which suggestions to take. In case you are interested in where that mentality comes from it is based on a change in policy for Montana, to support a program calld Buidling Bridges. You can find the resources here: Child Welfare site.might be an interesting read, we support it because we found we have so little control over the blocking an RU that we think is a bad idea, it makes more sense to do what we can to help the parent learn something.Thank you and I will definitely check it out! Maybe it's because I am in a kinship situation I feel differently, but in reality I am soooo willing to help those that want to be helped or just need a bit of guidance for that matter. I guess what's difficult in my situation is that I've always bailed out my older bio sister, I've always passed along advice and I've always tried to help, hence me having her 2 children for over a year. At the end of the day though I can say, from experience, there is some people who don't want to change or don't want help they just want it handed to them. Believe me, I didn't think such a thing was true, but my views through all of this have changed. I am all for RU if it's the right thing, at the end of the day I want to be a 20 something year old, live life and start my own family. But I also know I have to protect these two kiddos I have right now and I would love to just help and do simple tasks to help, but I have and it's got me no where, it's only made by bio sister look capable of raising 2 kids that she at this point, IMHO, may not be able to. I know CPS will prob. RU and I will continue to pass along advice that may help it making the transition back easier for the children. But at this point I feel like I can't keep providing things making her look like someone she is not...(clearly this would be changed if it was not good for the children).Again, I hope this is coming out clearly and not the wrong way, but just my point of view. I do how ever really like other points of views because it does help me question what I am doing and whether its the right thing or maybe I can try something different/new. I know its easy to get caught up and loose sight of what the 'right' way is, at least for me....Thank you again for all the insight!  \n",
      "newmama30Just wanted to mention your niece is old enough to learn how to warm food up in the microwave, if they have one. You could teach her how to do that, so that if it come's down to it at least she knows. My bd is 8 1/2 and is just learning how to make speggetti, and mac and cheese, but has been using the microwave since she was 5. Excellent suggestion. We haven't worked on warming things up, but have worked on making sandwiches and mac and cheese and such. But that's great advice...I will definitely have to look up some good recipes for kids with minimal ingredients and start working on that more...Also, we are working on politely asking when we are hungry as well, I think they are used to me knowing the schedule and having it out, but learning it's okay to ask or reminding is okay to do as well, and maybe offer to help!! Only slight problem is and this is where problem lied this past weekend is bio mom is horrible about shopping and so my niece said she asked but bio mom said she had no food, which is very typical from past experience.  \n",
      "My nephew does't sound like he was quite at the same level as your little one, but he definitely was close. We got him in speech classes, and tried to really interact with him. It sounds like what you are doing is great. I know like when he talked or tried to we would then repeat it back again and even add in a few extra words. His response: 'The truck' , Our response: 'oh the blue truck on the table', he still has trouble to this day, but we just continue what we've been doing, lots of reading, always explaining (or trying to at least) what we are doing, lots of fun adventures and crafts and pre-k has helped tremendously. I am so sorry for your little one and wish you the best of luck!!! :-) Oh and you may try searching the internet or checking our Pinterest for lots of fun activities. I know the other thing they've talked to us about at pre-k is his lack of fine motor skills, cutting, pasting, writing etc. So definitely consider some of that stuff as well because it can be very interactive and teach a lot.  \n",
      "I often feel the same way...today was our first day of school as well, it was so exciting, but on the other hand I wondered if my niece was thinking her parents should be there instead of me/as well as me....All I know is i have learned i have to do the best I can for her, parents aside, I ALWAYS do my best to make sure it's the best it can be...maybe one day the parents will call/e-mail on the day of to make it special for her, but usually not...I can't imagine it's easy and it's makes me so sad for them at times...The other day they didn't even call or do anything for her birthday, grated they did give her a little something at the visit almost 5 days later, but still... I wish you guys all the best today and I hope your little guy enjoys school!!!  \n",
      "Awwww I did the same thing!!!! Pinterest? Hehe  \n",
      "Wow, I am so sorry you are having to go through that, I am afraid I will be there all too soon. I think what you are feeling is completely normal and as many PP have said time heals all. I can't say I know what you are currently feeling, but I know I don't look forward to the day where I will probably find out. Then to add the fact that they aren't coming home to a warm comfortable place makes it all the more hard. I've said if my niece and nephew go home I'm gonna just take a week long vacation why someone comes and packs up all their stuff...I honestly don't think I could do it, nor could I imagine finding little reminders here and there. I am so sorry for the pain you are feeling and I wish there was some way to make it go away...  \n",
      "Maybe there is a poll already circulating like this, but we just got word that after 13 months are kiddos will be transitioning home over the next 3 months. We are going from a couple hour visits a week to full blow weekend overnights and then a 2 week stay before the next court date. For those that have BTDT: 1. How did it work for you and your kiddos? Emotion wise, time wise, parents sticking to the routine? 2. For an extended transition like ours will be (3 months) how many had your bios give up at this point? 3. How many of you actually had children go back home and how long before they came back into the system or did they? I frankly have know freaking idea what I hope for at this point. I would love for them to go home to a warm healthy home in a decent place, but I know it's NEVER gonna happen. On the other hand a piece of me wants them to stay so badly. Although, sometimes I don't know that my spouse wants the same....he loves them, but I know he wants our own life and our 'own' family and I get that, but how do you go back to 'normal' life as a single couple after a year and a half?  \n",
      "TemporaryMom When did bf become spouse? (I swore you posted BF wen you first got the kids) I must have missed that, congrats!. No matter what happens, when the kids grow up they will appreciate the love you and hubby gave them. Hehe, we aren't there yet, but minds well be. We've been together over 9 years, and I mean lets be real any guy who sticks around with this kinda drama, must be pretty awesome ;-) Sometimes it's just so much easier to say we're married...we meet so many new people with kiddos and it sounds so informal, imo, to say my bf, then I feel like I have to explain he's my bf but we live together and been together forever just have other things going on right now...yada yada. And explaining why you randomly have 2 new kids is enough :-)  \n",
      "My niece often does what you are explaining (she just turned 7) in terms of the finding the one thing we didn't do when we did fun stuff the bulk of the day...It bugged really bad at first and I'd be lying if I said it still does sometimes, but I think it's part of the age and part of a manipulation tactic. I simply try to ignore it. Or let her know we did plenty of fun stuff let's think about those things instead, life isn't ALWAYS fair or exactly how we planned. As for the crying and outbursts. It sounds to me a bit like a cry for attention/manipulation. My niece doesn't pull this thank goodness. I would stand firm let her know you are the parent, let her know it's okay to be upset, but honestly i don't know if I would always give into it. I mean IMO you kind of begin to get a feel for when things are maybe being over dramatized to get our way vs. being literally upset....Maybe find some time (15 minutes) each day to devote to just her. My niece is still going to bed at 7;30 and I notice on days she doesn't she seems to be a bit of a basket case....It took a bit to get there, but it's been awesome for her... Or possibly try and get her to be more your 'helper' throughout the day and let her know she's a big kid now and gets to do fun things like help you! This may be good for her....I hope it all works out!  \n",
      "I am feeling a bit torn. My niece's birthday was this weekend. We did a birthday party and it all went quite well and she seemed very happy with all of it. I am feeling bad though because neither her mom or dad even called, dropped anything by or e-mailed. They don't typically, the simply just have their visits each week, but I still feel like not even a phone call or a card? I was tempted to call them yesterday for her, but decided against it. She didn't ask and I don't think it's my responsibility to track them down to make them call. I offered up an extra visit today but never heard back either. I guess I'm just feeling bad. And I keep wondering if she is thinking 'Why didn't they even call?' I guess I am wondering did I do the right thing or should I have tracked them down? Uggghhhh...  \n",
      "I know this can be such a pain, my kiddos are the same way 4 & 7, in bed between about 7:30 - 8, but on visit times it can be a bit later because they aren't even home until about 7ish. Somethings we've started doing that have helped, sending a packed dinner with them, and having a little pb&j ready when they walk in the door if they didn't get enough. Everything is laid out for bed, with our nephew (4) it's literally a 3-5 minute scrub down shower, maybe 5-10 minutes of play, reading and bed. We've got it down to about a 20 minute process. It stinks and the kids get upset we can't hang out and play but it's what it's got to be for now. I'm dreading beginning overnights and such I KNOW the schedule will not be anything near the same...Grrrrr.....Good luck I know is't frustrating...  \n",
      "and just want to say stop talking....when all the kids talk about is their parents!? I make a huge effort to say nothing negative towards bio mom (my sister) and bio dad, but it is often ALL I ever hear about, how WONDERFUL THEY ARE. We are up to 3 couple hour visits a week and it's all fun and games at this point, park, picnics, dinner out etc. When they are not with their parents they are CONSTANTLY asking are they going with them, when will they be here, I'm so excited about mom and dad, I can't wait to see them. Now my nephew (4) when he get's on time out sits and screams that he wants his mommy, probably because she would NEVER EVER make him do something as 'awful' as a time out, he has no rules with her. Yesterday was even my birthday and I said I'm bummed you guys won't be home to celebrate (it was visit night) and they said we don't care we want to go with our parents, but save us some cake? Sometimes it just gets old. Especially when I know their parents have every right to get them back sooner than later and are simply choosing to drag it on....I get they're just kids and they probably want their parents, but give my ears a break!!!!!! Ugghhhh. I'm so tired of trying so hard and maybe they care, but it sure doesn't feel like it sometimes... :-(  \n",
      "We have this to a degree with my 4 y.o nephew. He tends to be pretty good for us, has his moments, but as soon as he gets with someone new or someone he knows how to work over...BOOM, it's a new kid! We are having such an issue with him at preschool and i think it's because the teachers aren't tough enough with him, it's redirecting and talking too's as opposed to a 'time out.' Once our guy knows whose more of a 'friend' or doesn't have rules, it's game over for them. I feel really bad for others, but again we don't see it as much when he's just with us. I definitely know he does it and have seen it, but we know to not EVER let the strings loose on him. He can't handle it. So all in all what I am suggesting is maybe your parents need to lay down the law a bit more and make it's clear whose boss. I hope it gets better soon. I know it's exhausting and we'd love to give our little guy a break, but we've learned the hard way that he can't handle it, he needs structure and discipline.  \n",
      "I'm doing kinship placement for my niece and nephew, first time parent as well and I can definitely tell you, you are not alone on your feelings... There are times where it doesn't even cross my mind for a long span, but then one of those bad days happens and I question everything. The kids often remind me why I am doing what I am doing, although they don't realize it, but on the other hand they often make me question what I'm doing as well :-) I think in my case, if I didn't know their parents as well as I do maybe i would feel differently. There are a lot of things I don't like about the bios and I often find myself picking up on things the kids are doing and comparing. Plus knowing they're just dragging their feet, but will still get the kids back, but don't care enough to do it faster is hard... Plus seeing them multiple times a week for visits, well that just sucks as well. So no you are not alone. Bad days happen....  \n",
      "Is there a way to get information on caseworkers and judges, such as how they have dealt with cases or how they have ruled etc? I'm wondering if anyone has been successful at gaining some background insight?  \n",
      "So 12 month court is in a little over a week. We keep being told kids will be transitioned home, but that of course has not happened at all... So I wrote CW to see where we stood and what do you know....it's gonna be at least a few more months. Grrrrrr! On top of that she had the audacity to say I needed to drive the kids to and from my sisters (bio moms) new place that is 25+ minutes each way. Ummmm, no, I work full time, go to school full time and I'm already raising her kids full time. Then the CW ended the e-mail with the fact she needs to help bios get stuff for their place, which she help get them setup with, the government pays for it and it's fully furnished...At what point do they have to be adults and do it for themselves!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????? It's so frustrating! Let's keep handing them thing after thing after thing, hoping some lightbulb will click on and they will figure it out, but in reality CPS is going to leave the situation and they won't have somebody wiping their butts for them and we'll all be right in the same stupid situation....Am I wrong here? Vent over :-)  \n",
      "I have my niece and nephew, so unfortunately their parents already know my address and phone #. I do teach it to both them, 4 & 7. In case they ever go back i want to make sure they know how to reach us or where to find us if there was ever an emergency or something. Maybe ask bio mom what phone # or address she would like your FS to know, if you feel comfortable with that...  \n",
      "You didn't over think it...I did the same thing as a first time parent with my nephew who moved in, he just turned 4. But when he moved in he was 3 and one day touched my boobs and called the 'bobo's.' At first i was super concerned until I heard it seemed to be a pretty normal thing at that age and just explained that those are areas we don't touch...It happened maybe once or twice more, we had the same talk and it hasn't happened since.  \n",
      "This has been a big question of mine if my niece and nephew are RU. I do plan to continue to be apart of their lives, but on the other hand as some of you are pointing out, 'sometimes it's better not to know.' I know the situation my niece and nephew came from and it prob. is not as horrible as some people situations, but on the other side of that I have been their parent for over a year now and I don't agree with what they are going back to or how they will be raised. I guess what i am saying is to a degree how do you turn off the parent part and just shut my eyes to what I don't like and continue to just be Aunt and Uncle? I think it may be very tough. But i guess if I can't handle that my only other option is to seperate myself from their lives, which I don't believe is the right answer either (although bio dad may not give another option). By the way I do realize that I am in a fortunate situation to still be apart of my niece and nephew lives after all is said and done. I know some of you don't even get that chance and I can't imagine how that must feel.  \n",
      "I am so sorry this is happening, this sounds exactly like our case with my bio sister...She is supposedly 'mentally ill' and can do nothing for her self, but they are thinking of sending the kids home in 2.5 weeks....which just seems crazy to me. IMO it seems like they keep just handing her what she needs so they can push the kids back, government housing, cell phone, transportation passes, helping her get setup for any assistance possible, including disability. But yet she can't get a job, even a basic Walmart job when she hasn't even had her kids for over a year? My question is, how can a person who can't even get a job or support herself raise two children? Good luck with everything in your case.  \n",
      "TemporaryMomThose so-called Psyche evaluations are a joke.  I have not personally been involved with one, but this is what I have been saying since my sister's case since day one. All I keep getting told by the CW is 'These tests are so accurate, there is no way your sister could fake it.' Well clearly they don't know my sister and what she is capable of, IMO...she's a con-artist and if it means free money and having to do nothing, well she will to what she has to do...that includes saying she is having thoughts about hurting her children....it's sickening. I am sure there may be people that truly are mentally ill, I don't want to minimize that. But in the case of my niece and nephew something just isn't adding up.  \n",
      "For those who have BTDT, how often does the judge rule against what the CW is recommeding? I am just wondering if it ever happens... My niece and nephew are set to go home in about 2.5 weeks (at the 12 month court reviewing) per the CW, but I just know it's still not a better situation for them and in my opinion things are really being rushed in these last few weeks to push them home. Bio mom and dad still wont even have a place until maybe late this week, they have a horrible relationship and haven't been living together for a year and now they will be doing that as well as shoving the kids home...bio mom still doesn't have a job, bio dad is hardly working, but maybe 2-3 days a week and he just lost his car and so neither parent now drives. How is this situation any better? Another question while I am thinking of it, if the judge does rule to send them home, does it happen like that day or how does that work? What typically do you send with them? I am a bit hesitant to send EVERYTHING....we've got them some really nice things, and past experience my sister (bio mom) gets rid of, lets the kids destroy or sells most things. I hate to punish the kids, but on the other hand I feel like its stuff that can stay at our house for when they come visit...or how about bedding? Again, I believe they will hopefully still be able to visit, does that mean I should go buy new bedding to send home with them or leave that up to bio mom and dad to get their own and I keep what we have? Goodness I have sooo many emotions right now, I'm excited to maybe have back my life, but on the other hand i'm not sure if I remember what life is without my two kiddos. I don't think I mind the fact they will be going home to their mom and dad, what sucks is knowing they're going to a situation that is not any better..also the fact that their parents really did the bare minimum to get their kids back, to me it seems like they're doing it because they get bigger checks as well as a place bio mom and bio dad can live in together, not because they want to do better for their children...and unfortunately they likely hood it will work out seems slim to none imho...I hope I am wrong...  \n",
      "LemonPieWhere I am it does happen -- most often if there is someone effectively contesting (e.g., GAL, therapist, attorney) or on a point of law.   I am not certain what you mean by this, do you mind clarifying? I am glad, I think, to hear it does happen. We have two CW's (co working) our case. The one who has been on it since like day one is saying continue for mom terminate RU services for dad. The newer CW (only been on our case 3 months) is saying send them home...so there seems to be some miss comunication somewhere and I hope a judge will actively look at the case to decide the best option.  \n",
      "UTbrie Have you considered whether you would take them back if the bio's fail during RU or shortly after? I know this kinship placement has wreaked havoc on your life and the bios put a lot of stress on you with their behavior. Yes we have thought VERY long and hard about it and I think that is where a lot of my reservations are with them going back. I don't think the parents have changed enough, if at all, to make this work, too much is still the same, even worse in some areas. At least at this point in time, thats my feeling. If the kids were to come back into care we have said to please let us know and we will decide where we are at, at that point in time. On the other side, I know my sister and I know the bio dad, they know the kids have a great life with us (even they've said it) and if they need an out or a few weeks or even a year off they know we're that out. Unfortunately I think if/when the kids go back into care we may have to take a step back. It just sucks soooo badly because it's the kids that get punished...but at the same time I know we can't continue to enable this behavior because really this is not good for the kids either...It just really sucks is all I know...And I thought we had 6 more months with them so the thought of saying goodbye in 2.5 weeks is crushing...These next couple of weeks when bios get their government housing will be quite telling. The kids have this idea that they're basically going back to the life they have here, but with their bios, which is sooooooooo false!!! We have mentioned things here and there about it possibly being different and they refuse to believe it. So if overnights start in the next couple of weeks we could have some issues on hand. Or best case, maybe kids will just be thrilled to have their parents back and not care...  \n",
      "irq11 On one hand I absolutely don't think you should buy something like bedding as that should be the parents' responsibility. On the other hand ... will the parents even have that? :confused: (will they even have beds??) Is there some non-confrontational way you can ask the CW if they will inspect the new housing to ensure the kids have the necessary items? You really don't want to have to buy everything all over again if you do end up taking in the kids again ... and you'll need it anyway for visits. I am amazed they want to send the kids back almost as soon as the parents get housing ... considering it's taken this long to get the housing, shouldn't the parents have to show some stability in keeping that housing? Hope it all works out somehow. :confused: Thanks for the feed back. I really like your idea if it's something they throw a total fit over go try to get something else, without promoting the fit of course. Although, they prob. have plenty to take with them and keep at our house, they are a bit spoiled hehe!!! :-) As for bedding and beds and stuff the CW claims they will go inspect house before kids go there, I hope this is true, but it seems like a lot of things are said to just make me happy and to get me to stop asking, but doesn't seem to really happen. So we will see. I plan on taking kids over there for first visit to kind of scope things out myself. I am shocked they are pushing them back this quick as well, then on the other side of it I'm not holding my breath, I've learned in 2.5 weeks everything can change. So we will see for sure soon. Plans have already changed bio mom was moving into place on Wends, but it's already now moved to Friday. I think the reason they are sending them back so quickly is because my niece starts school at the end of the month. She will be going to a new school if she stays with us or goes with them, and if they are going to push them back earlier than later I'd rather her only start at 1 new school as opposed to starting at 1 and quickly moving to another. Although, most importantly I do want to make sure it's safe to be going home and the right move at this point...  \n",
      "I was new to parenting one year ago today! Now I'm not sure what it will be like to perhaps to not be one again soon. Everyday we are still working at getting that grove, but here are some things we've got down. 1. Dry erase board with days of the week put everything on there so you don't forget things. 2. Get everything ready the night before, clothes, cereal bowl out, put things in one central location to remember etc. 3. Does she have visits or do a preschool program at least a few days a week, this may be a great time to get errands/chores done. If not maybe check out a preschool program even if it's only a few days a week or half days. 4. I work all day as well and I try really hard to make time for the kiddos after, i try to save my stuff until after bedtime (sometimes easier said than done). I get home at 5, make dinner, we all sit down and eat together, then we do either outside time (which I always try to join in, riding bikes, scooters etc), then it's shower and then we try to all sit and watch a show together, play a game, build something etc. Then it's story time and lights out by 7:45ish. The early bed time is HUGE! This is when I sit down for my online college courses, get the laundy going, or sometimes theres those nights still i just lay and watch TV :-) etc. Best recommendation is if you can get a routine down and early bed time it can do wonders! At least it has in our situation. There are definitely days with interuptions, but at this point it's all pretty routine and the kids love it! Good luck!  \n",
      "SFrati Pintrest has some great tot activities that can keep them occupied for hours. Have a glass of wine after the little ones bedtime and watch your favorite movie. I completely agree with these as well! :clap:  \n",
      "Super interesting. My question is it keeps referencing legal guardianship. So as FP's to my niece and nephew I would assume that this last year may not count since we are not \"legal guardians.\" Also, I wonder like in my niece and nephews case there is a good chance RU may happen in the next month. Assuming this does, I of course hope the best, but have belief that it may not lost anymore than a few weeks to a couple of months. I wonder if in the courts eyes this would me the 2 year time period would start over or if we'd pick up where we left off if we did get them back. Any thoughts?  \n",
      "Yes this happened to us as well...we weren't as concerned, but did want to make sure when we first began that bios couldn't just come pick up the kids one day...what we did... Get something written up from the CW that stated what the parents visitation time was and gave that to the school. They accepted that. Also gave them the letter saying we were the current FP's. Also, we made very good friends with the teacher and basically made it clear we were the only ones to pick up my niece and to let me know if something happens otherwise. There was a day early on in the school year that the parents did come to pick up my niece (it was the first time and truly was for a visitation) they did not know where her classroom was and went into the office. Even the office had become familiar with us and the situations (because CW's and therapists sometimes went to the school for visits) and they first contacted the teacher and then myself. Even though the school had nothing in writing at that point they went to that extent...it was awesome! I hadn't even considered letting the school know about the visits because i did not think it was an issue, but it was at that point they had me provide the more formal letters from the CW. So all in all simply becoming friends with the teacher and just letting them know that if anyone other than myself comes to pick him/her up please be cautious. Good luck!  \n",
      "I am so sorry for you and these childrens. This sounds horrible. If she can't handle the older boys what in the world makes the judge even considering sending a baby home? It's so sad how a lot of these cases play out some times...I wish you all the best.  \n",
      "I do kinship, but its for my niece and nephew who are much younger and their parents are in the same county. So I can't give you all the advice you are looking for, but here is what I know. Kinship care giving can be very tough, I personally know too much about their background and have too many feelings towards the situation and that really can get the best of me at times. Bio mom (my sister) and bio dad really tried to take advantage of the situation for quite a few of the first few months and it took a lot to push through that and set up boundaries. The CW at times, I feel, does not help/give me the same help I think ordinary FP's possibly receive and I have been threatened that if I am not friend's with bio's they will remove the kids??With all that said, it feels amazing to take in two kids I have watched grow up and that I love very much. It is awesome to watch them grow and change. At times I see a lot of their parents in the, which is hard (and maybe I wouldn't see it as much if I wasn't related) but truthfully as you said I can't imagine putting them in a random foster home. Overall they are great kids and when it comes to them and what I feel is best I wouldn't have it any other way...Good luck and really just follow what your heart says and make sure you and your partner are on the same page, if you're not a team about this it will make it very tough. Also, I am in CA so it may be different, but definitely look in to possible kinship assistance, here we get the same as the foster care rate.  \n",
      "I think you said it perfect and I would not worry...I know those are such tough situations and it truly is interesting when they question things, it seems like at such random times. But I think at those ages they see something on tv, at school, at the park or something that get them thinking.... It's so sad IMO when they start to put things together...it breaks my heart. Good luck.  \n",
      "My niece was 5 when she got her's out. It was a fairly quick process and recovery time. She was in quite a bit of pain for the first day or two and then she just said it felt more like a sore throat for a week or so. She was back up and around by day 2. The pain medication really helped. And make sure you have lots of soft foods to eat!!! Good luck, hope it goes well!!  \n",
      "Poor thing, I think it's really unfair they won't allow you to tell her. I believe my niece has some pretty sever anxiety at times, and surprises really get her going. She has even asked us to please make sure we tell her in advance, and she is only 6. So if there is a way to tell her I would really try. I mean as a pp said maybe they are concerned bm won't show, but she can be told that as well. I really hope it all works out for the best...  \n",
      "So for those that didn't read my prior post, the recommendation for our 12 month review hearing in a few weeks is to, 'Continue mom's RU services but terminate dad's.' I asked the CW what this mean exactly? Remind you we have had a 'fill in' CW that started at about the 9 month mark, then we were told she would be our replacement CW, then we were told she is co-working with our previous CW. With all that said, I received and e-mail from the 'fill-in' CW basically saying the CW that was on the case for 9 months (that is still co-working the case) wrote the report and it's totally wrong and she doesn't agree at all, she will be changing it and that she is looking at sending the kids back before our court date in a few weeks. WTH!!!? How can they be on such different pages? Also, mind you the 'fill-in' CW still has not even met myself or the kids. So how in the world can she just go and change the report? This makes no since! Grrrrrr....and the saga continues.... Any recommendations?  \n",
      "Just rec'd notice of review hearing documents about our upcoming 12 month review, and I am surprised by what it says as well as confused... Any insight would be appreciated... It said, \"Continue FR services to MO and terminate FR services to FA.\" I get the mother part, but the father part is what I am confused by. Does this mean that he's cleared and everything is fine with him and they're no longer offering services? Or does it mean his rights are moving toward termination? I'm confused...  \n",
      "Or does it mean they area heading to terminating rights with him?  \n",
      "Thanks everyone for the replies, it was kind of what I was thinking it meant.Honestly, I am just SHOCKED. This whole case has been about mom and her mental illness, not at all about dad, so I am really confused what happened? He's been at 98% of visits so I know it's not that... I mean I know the guy is a loser, and could have kept his kids in the first place, but decided to dump them on us instead, but I am not clear what he did to get FR services terminated. I also know he just got his car taken away and I am not real clear if he's working or where he is living, but I wouldn't think that would cause it...Of course it's just a new wrench in the whole thing.Does anyone know, if mom get RU with the kids and they move back in with her, which there has been talks of recently since she is moving into a shelter where they can live, how does this play out for dad? Would he be able to live there and continue to raise them?  \n",
      "Blue_Suede_Shoes On a side note, I really think you should try to avoid judgments on the parents like \"loser,\" especially if you're hoping to adopt. Whatever else he did or didn't do, the children have half their DNA from him, and he's part of them. It's possible to judge his actions (\"he didn't do the work required to get the children back even though he could have parented\") rather than his character as a person. I agree with your point. But respectfully I am related and our case goes much deeper than even this. I would never ever say something like that in front of my niece and nephew. But with what I know...maybe I am horrible for saying this...but he is a loser...In the future I will try to watch what I put in my posts.  \n",
      "CRAZY_WOMANBut doesn't he stay with the mom, or are they trying to claim they don't?Currently I don't think they are 'living together.' She is at a place where I believe he cannot live. But I do believe the plan is to get the kids back because then they are able to move into a 'family' housing unit...So I think there is an ulterior motive beyond simply wanting the children back. It will be interesting, because in the next few weeks supposedly she moves into her 'family' unit and from there overnights will quickly begin, and in my opinion this is going to really show us if they are up for doing it again. I think the first few nights will be fine, but then I think they'll give up. IMO, but who knows, I hope they can prove me wrong!  \n",
      "Oh my goodness, you are living our life. We get reprimanded almost every day for my nephew's behavior at school. He just turned 4, is quite high strung but a sweet boy. They are saying the same to us it sounds like your little guys' teachers are. But it's almost every day at this point for the last 2 weeks. We have tried EVERYTHING i feel like. And he says he enjoys school so we are not clear what the issue is. I think it's the age, I hope!!!! We are so embarassed at this point. I will say though (he's been with us just about a year) his behavior has improved a lot at home. So not sure why he is behaving this way at school. All I can think is he knows he can no longer get away with things with us and so maybe he's moved on to new 'victims' :-) Good luck and please let me know if you find the magical fix!!!!  \n",
      "So we just got word that my niece and nephew may be going back much sooner than anticipated...not certain however. Received e-mail from my sister (bio mom) saying she moves into place in next week and a half or so. We have court mid way through August and she is thinking the kids may go back with her at that time. I have been told that it sounded like the case was pretty much waiting on her to get a place, so this may be true. I wrote the CW to see if she could confirm or deny this, because it would so nice to prepare the children as well as to be able to plan our lives a bit. I was a bit bummed when I heard this. It will be hard to see them go, but on the other hand, I do think they want to be back with there parents for better or for worse. The last few weeks have been a bit rough. The kids have this idea of their parents in their head and it's a great image, we don't compare...and I'm afraid we probably never will. They more often than not let us know that 'their' parents are right, we are not and it's not that great here. I think they know in the backs of their minds that's not the case, but at the same time I am tired of feeling like the bad guy. So all in all if it is true I am glad they may be getting what they want. But sadly I think they are going to be dissapointed by the reality when they find out it's not all fun and games and visits at the park with mom and dad. But maybe it's time for them to get that dose of reality. Truthfully I think I am feeling a bit relieved...I feel bad because I do love them, but I didn't sign up for this and I want to create my own life, not clean up someone elses, especially my sister's who doesn't care to even clean up her own life. At this point I am feeling one way, but have learned that can very quickly change. I am lucky that they are my niece and nephew and if they do go home I hope to remain a big part of their lives. But if its true they are leaving sooner than later I will deeply miss than but strangely enough I am a bit excited at the prospect of what that might mean in my life....  \n",
      "@irq11 - no they technically were \"abadoned\" or so they said because my sister left them with me and it had been a month and then CPS randomly showed up. They ended up officially taking them into care because mom supposedly suffers from mental illness and was living in a shelter and had said she had thoughts about hurting the kids. Bio dad is around but he I was told is not technically apart of the case??? Although he was given a case plan and will be living with bio mom and children and always has. Let's also not forget to mention he is an alcoholic and was in rehab for quite some time, but that apparently plays no role. Confusing...I know, I don't quite get it myself. Pretty much I've been told as long as mom is compliant on meds and gets a place kids will go back. And well it looks like we're there.  \n",
      "CRAZY_WOMANI would keep your doors open, she'll probably stop taking her pills as soon as she gets the kids back. It sounds like their rushing for some reason. It doesn't sound like a good idea, after all the stuff you've said. I completely agree with you. Unfortunately I believe it will be a matter of weeks/months that mom is going to 'get tired' of dealing with them and cry wolf. Especially since she has had an entire year off...she's got used to the single life i am sure. I love my niece and nephew and the CW has asked if our doors open if and when this happens again and truthfully we said we can't for sure give a yes, but we are not saying no. We feel terrible not giving a 100% yes, but knowing my sister this will be a back and forth game for years to come. And I can't keep doing this limbo game....I am doing the best I can, but I know that at some point I may have to step away. It just sucks that it's two kids that may suffer because of that. But on a brighter note, maybe this year off has helped my sister and she will do great! (doubtful, but there is wishful thinking, right?)  \n",
      "We are in the same boat as you. It sounds as if you are explaning are Bub to a T. Our guy is 4 and a couple of months. He's a good kid, smart and knows right from wrong because he tells us the rules quite often. The teachers have said he is quite the problem at school. Most, if not all the kids don't like him because he is the bully, which actually is a bit shocking to me...They say he yells at kids, he tells them what to do and sometimes will even taking it as far as hitting them. The teachers say he often doesn't listen, thinks everything is a game and yells back at them. We've talked to him and he knows he is wrong. He says he LOVES school. And for the most part he is a good kid at home. So I am so unclear what is going on. We were unsure should he be punished at home or just leave it at school. But he isn't changing his behavior at all so we've resorted to no bike or video game time when he gets home if he got a bad report at school. Those are privledges he loves, but we don't feel he should get to do them after a bad report at school. I don't know if it's the right answer, but we are a bit stuck. We are getting a talking to by the teacher nearly every day....It's quite frustrating because we are working so hard with him and teaching him the right thing and he genuinely does not seem to care!  \n",
      "I love the chip idea, I have been using check marks on a white board to praise good behavior, but sometimes forget to go over and mark it (shhh don't tell). I like the idea of putting a few in my pocket, purse etc. for when we are out an about etc. Thanks for the great advice.  \n",
      "We are a kinship placement so you would think we would get told some sort of information, but we get told nothing. And it's almost like I am putting the CW out by trying to ask where things are at or trying to get any type of information. Good luck!  \n",
      "I am so sorry you are having a frustrating day. I know those all to well and we are only coming up on a year.Have a nice big bowl of ice cream or drink of choice, sit down and relax. That helps me get through a bad day! :-)I hope it all works out soon!!!  \n",
      "I supervised the visits for my sister (bio mom) and bio dad in my home for the first 9.5 months of placement. Then about a month and a half ago, I found a local park and said sorry can't supervise any more and no more visits in my home. The CW very hesitantly got a family therapist who will supervise and added on a second visit that does not have to be supervised. But I just basically said I will drop the kids off, but won't say, sorry figure it out....and they did. I will add though that the CW has not been real pleasant to me since. I am not necessairly looking to adopt or foster more after my niece and nephew so I am not really looking to make friends or make sure they CW likes me. So I am in a bit of a different boat. So I understand you may have some hesitations toward taking this approach, but it has been so pleasant in terms of visits since I did....so in my experience it's really a choice, deal and have CW like you or don't and they may write you off. Good luck, the system gets people between such a rock and a hard place and its very unfair when you are just trying to do a good thing....  \n",
      "Nice job!! My CW gives me the same 'poor me' story...If you don't like it find a different job is my feeling. I didn't do this the bios did so if you have an issue take it up with them and tell them to get their crap together...just my feeling :-) Good job regardless!  \n",
      "That's really sad, I would do as some of the last posters said, have him say something nice to her after, or maybe he needs to do something nice. And yes, i would sit down and really make sure he understands that it's not nice and would he like to be treated that way? Or maybe he was and that's why he does it, because that is what he was taught. Maybe also try to carve out some time each week to do nice things for eachother, have him pick some flowers for her or do a craft for eachother or something of that sort.  \n",
      "I am wondering...is there anything I should do for the 12 month court date? I am a kinship placement, so I never really got any direction to begin with...We know the case is being extended 6 months. Is there anything I should do or bring with me to court? Will the judge ask to talk to us as the FP's or will they simply read the CW's report? Also, what are the chances the judge will overrule the 6 month extension that is being suggested by the CW's? Does that ever happen? Not much has changed in the parents case since day one. They do show up for visits, although they are only once a week for an hour and a half supervised. About one month ago 3 more hours got added on unsupervised. Bio Dad just lost his car and bio mom does not drive, they still have no where to live. Just wondering some BTDT...  \n",
      "controllnmychaosI hate to see it happen, but FS may have to be moved because my bs is getting ready to turn 13. They won't be able to share a room anymore. We love this child, but it has always been clear he is going back to mom (eventually:rolleyes: ) From my case and what I've read here I know the state has no problem dragging things out. 6m here, an extension there, a continuance, 6 more months. I have said so many times, when I give this up, it won't be because of the kids. It is dealing with DCS and the court system that drives me batty.:hissy:After this amount of time would they really just up and move the kid? It seems crazy that potentially bouncing these kids around so they can possibly go back to bios would be even considered, especially with the amount of time he has already been in care, as opposed to simply giving him a permanent home with you. When is enough, enough?I guess I am asking because we are weeks away from the 12 month mark and know that it's already getting extended to 18 months. I love my niece and nephew and would have no issue with them staying permanently. On the other hand I'm 26 and getting to the point I want to begin my own family. I have said since day 1 that I would not bring my own bio children into this mess. By mess I mean visits, bio's games, stresses, millions of things to do/places to go all the time. I want the limbo part to be gone. With that said I am afraid as well I may have to move my niece and nephew if they even consider extending this pass 18 months. That's horrible, because it truly is the parents who are doing just enough not to get them back, but to keep dragging it on. But at some point I have to move on with my life, without CPS and bios, right?  \n",
      "Sounds like you are well on your way, my nephew was 3 when he came to us, such a fun age. List of things... sounds like you are getting the essentials. We had my nephew in a toddler bed (found cheap on CraigsList) but he quickly decided he liked the full guest bed instead. Also, make sure to bolt anything like dressers or cabinents to the wall. Mine liked to climb when he first came. Let's just say I didn't think about attaching things to the walls...Ughhh. Also, a high latch up on things like the front door or door to the garage, ours was a wanderer as well, he doesn't do it anymore, but I still always keep it latched if I am doing stuff around the house, better to be safe then sorry. Here are some play items when you settle down a bit that have worked wonders for us, duplos, glider bike or scooter, books, coloring/sticker items, hot wheels, trains. Anything like that keeps them busy for hours. Also, he loves the white board to sit and color or write on, keeps him very busy! Good luck and I hope you guys have fun!!!  \n",
      "I'm so sorry, this whole situation can be so frustrating and then throw your own family into the mix and it makes it just that much more. I hope you can all come to some resonable agreement and that your family understand you have to do whats best for your nephew and respects you for that. Good luck!  \n",
      "I don't think it was wrong to enroll him, especially if you think he is ready. I know sometimes with boys they say it is better to start them later just because of the lack of maturity. But I say do what you think is best for him. I don't typically get permission from my sister when doing things, she doesn't typically raise a fuss though, but sometimes I wonder if she even remembers she has kids ;-P. I would maybe e-mail the CW and give a heads up or tell them the next time the come for a visit, nothing to complex, but just 'Oh and also 'Johnny' is starting school in August'. I don't think too much will be done about starting a child in school even if your sister does make a fuss...At least I would hope not.  \n",
      "Awww that's so cute!!! I'm glad you guys are having fun getting ready for school. My little man was so excited to start pre-k a couple months back...and he is still super excited to go each day!!! Too cute, they grow so much once they start school I feel like!!! Good luck, hope no conflict arrises for either of your sakes!  \n",
      "I am so sorry that you are going through this, I am especially sorry for the children involved. I'd like to believe people can change and I do think some can, but I do think there are some that can't as well...I hope everything works out for the best and your sister really considers what's best for her children...  \n",
      "I'm so sorry you are having to go through that. Is there any way you can request to be able to at least go and visit him until things are more definitive? Also, is there any way to go to the court hearing or as you said write a letter to the judge? I would think it would be in this child's best interest to go back with your family regardless, especially if you are willing to transport to the far away visits still....I really hope it works out for the best.  \n",
      "That's great! Sad to say, but I wonder if the summer is the reason kids are coming in...I wonder if a lot of parents just can't handle it...I know that's when my sister seemed to 'freak out' the most.  \n",
      "Classic!! Whatever works for you! :-) Glad it's got better.  \n",
      "Does anyone have any ideas on how to get a 4 year old boy to listen? He just turned 4 and just started pre-k, but the listening skills are very questionable!!! It's driving us crazy!!! I know he can do it, it's just selective and on his terms. We get a talking to like every other day by the teacher because the lack of...And often he will scream back or whine. Pretty good kid otherwise, but would love some insight...We've tried making sure we read everyday with him, have him repeat it back etc. etc. he does all of it , but still rarely listens. Now I must point out that he has a 6 year old sister that is very much the same...we've talked to her and told her it would be totally awesome if she would have really good listening because her brother thinks it's really cool to be like her. She is doing much better, but not him.... Please help!!!  \n",
      "Thank you all for the good ideas, I will look into/try them. We really need some help with the listening!@dizzilee- It's definitely complying, there is no issuing with understanding, because he has no problem pointing out if other people aren't doing something they should/shouldn't be. So he definitely gets it. It's a more of a 'I don't have to listen, I think I am the boss and when you tell me no I'm going to do it again just to test you (which he always gets a timeout for) or I'm just going to ignore you and smile at you so you know I hear you.' . They're good kids but both him and his sister (my niece and nephew) came from absolutely no rules. It's been almost a year with us and they know the rules here.  \n",
      "Thank you Kvas9 for the suggestions! We did just have his hearing screened and that is definitely not an issue. I truly believe it just stems down to behavior. He's a great listener when HE wants to be or if me and my spouse are trying to talk quitely to one another, well of course he can here that. Haha. I am really working on getting close and doing eye contact always not just rattling off what I want him to do. I need to try the whispering. And I know he loves silly....  \n",
      "@foster2forever - this is great advice, I do at times think he's over tired as well although he does sleep 7:30pm -8am, but often he will skip the naps. But on the other side of that I think he is just a defiant child as well, I think he wants to make sure we still have rules especially because mom and dad had none and he clearly craves it. I will check out the books you are recommending as well.  \n",
      "That is too cute, we often have the same conversations in more words or less...He LOVES to test me and my spouse...I am pretty good about not giving in, but sometimes he can make me want to laugh so hard and then he looks an give me that little bubba smile and it's so hard to remain firm. :-)  \n",
      "Very well said on so many levels. I am so happy for you and for your little man, but I know it's hard to be happy knowing what has all just occured. I wish you all the best on this 'new' journey...and hope that you all find peace with the decisions that were made.  \n",
      "Yes, you will quickly learn that it's hard to get the truth from bios or CW's. Or at least that has been our experience. I wish you all the best!!!  \n",
      "I post pics ALL the time of my niece and nephew. Lots of people ask and I just say they're staying with us for awhile. No one ever told me I couldn't, but as you said I don't think kinship placements get the same rules given at the beggining. I am not friends with bios, and if someone wants to pass pics along I figure so be it. They can see how happy and how much fun their kids are having and what they're missing out on. If it's something I don't want certain people to see or have I simply don't post it. Our whole family knows the situation and no one talks to my bio sister. But as I said if she sees pics I post I hope she may for once think 'Wow, I missed out on that, maybe I should get my butt in gear if I want my kids back and to enjoy these moments with them.' So with that said I think it's really up to you. If it bothers you that bad I would simply not post pics. I do believe there is a way to make it though so only 'friends' can see your stuff and not 'friends of friends'. For whatever it's worth. I can say I felt the same way as you at the beginning and still do when it comes to a lot of things. I don't want bios to be involved in my or the kids business if they're not even going to make an attempt to do the right thing. Then I realized there is just somethings I had to let go of. Good luck!  \n",
      "I can honestly say I don't think I was told anything as a kinship placement. I have read a few thing on here that I just think are crazy, no facebook pics, no haircuts w/o permission. I do stuff not even thinking twice. Maybe here in Cali. it's not as strict or maybe my CW just doesn't care, but no one has ever said anything about any of it. So who knows...I just live my life just like I plan to when I have my own biological children. I guess that is one way I have it pretty easy with my kiddos... :-)  \n",
      "Yep we have the same problems. I've given up on our CW. They really have no regard for us or for the kids, their only interest is in helping the bios who don't even help themselves. I have found that when I call or ask for something simple it always backfires on me in a HUGE way, I'm made out to be the bad guy...it's no fun at all. Hope it works out for you....maybe try calling someone hire up or calling the GAL?  \n",
      "I don't think you are cruel or heartless, I would have done the same thing...knowing my kiddos were okay of course. Our bios do the same thing, visits are at the park and the kids get ice cream sandwiches, snow cones etc...but god forbid they actually bring dinner, nope I have to provide that! I'm sorry the poor little thing had to go through that and I'm glad she is fine now, but not feeling real bad for bio mom. That's what 'moms' are suppose to do right, limit junk food for kids because they don't know any better? Karma at it's finest :-)  \n",
      "I had the same exact issue with my nephew. It wasn't until about 6 months ago (he was just over 3.5) we just did the cold turkey idea. I just took all diapers and got rid of them and put him in underwear. There were a few accidents and visitation days weren't the best, but it's been about 4 months and no accidents :-) (knock on wood). We still did pull ups at night and then about 2 months ago he said he didn't want to do those anymore either, so we trusted him and went for it. No diapers or accidents since! I think it really just depends on the kid, but the cold turkey worked best for us, if you truly know he's ready. Always keep extra clothes where ever you go. Oh and get him lots of easy on and off pants/shorts, the buttons make it VERY tough for them to do it on their own. Good luck!  \n",
      "Is it normal for a 6 year old girl to just genuinely seem unhappy most of the time? I don't remember feeling that way or acting that way at that age, but maybe I just don't remember... It just seems like you can never please her. We can be doing something fun and she already has moved on and what's to know what we are doing next. She can't seem to entertain herself at all. And genuinely just seems unhappy a lot of the time. For example: Last night going to bed she was complaining that I work and the summer is no fun, yada yada...I said I was sorry I have to work, but it's so we can do fun stuff when I am home and so we can afford fun stuff. Now mind you when we all get home I really try to make sure I focus on them up until bed time because I do realize I work 9-5. She goes to a great day camp that does TONS of stuff including filed trips and when I pick her up she usually doesn't want to leave because she is having so much fun. But nope none of that is good enough, she wants to swim. I reminded her she does swimming lessons every week...nope that's not good enough. So I asked her, what is one thing here that makes you happy and she said well nothing really, I guess maybe my books. Which I know is NOT the only thing!!!! So I left her room last night and asked her to please think about it... Another example: We took her to Disneyland and she literally ruined the trip for all of us because she was so miserable. But then we got home and it's all she talks about ever since, bascially says how it's the best place on earth... I know it may have a bit to do with the age, but any suggestions for a kid that just really seems unhappy. We work really hard at helping her see the positive, but it seems like she just can't most of the time...I feel bad for her, but it also drives us crazy! We aren't downer people so it's hard to be around sometimes... Any thoughts, suggestions??  \n",
      "Well it sounds like this may be a bit typical of girls. She definitely can have her happy moments, mainly when you speak of cats. And I try not to take any of it personally because I know she enjoys what she has and does. I sometimes think maybe she is stuck in the groove of her old life, even though it's been over a year. Or I wonder if she sometimes thinks that the life with her parents would be better or has dreamed up a better life with them, which it absolutely will be no where close to the same. The thing that I think scares me the most is I see so much of her mom in her when she is like this. She was so happy go lucky growing up and now that she is a bit older it seems to have changed a lot, she doesn't seem to have much confidence, is scared of her own shadow and just can be so unhappy at times. Maybe it will just take time, and i love when she is in a happy mood, but I feel it takes so much for her to get there and it makes me so sad for her. More than anything i wish I could just help and no what she was thinking... We did recently get a one on one therapist. I had to really push for it, but I'm hoping maybe something will come of it. Thanks for the posts, it makes me feel better knowing there are others out there experiencing what we are...  \n",
      "I'm glad to hear that! I have my niece and nephew, but I am concerned what will happen if they go back and I have this inkling RU may only last for so long. I know in our case they will absolutely remember us, but I get concerned whether or not they could move back in if RU does not work because I am concerned of the kids they may become. I hope they remember what we have taught them, but realistically I know it may not be the case. Only will time will tell I guess...I'm sorry your FD had to go through that, but I am so happy to hear she has come back around!  \n",
      "AMEN!I hate that bios act like parents of the year, when the supervisor is around.I hate they can't even bring dinner for the visit that happens once a week. I hate that they just go to a park and eat ice cream and make the kids think that's what they'll go back to.I hate that dad 'hides' his car like we don't know it's parks a 1/4 mile up the streetI hate that when we did a drive by during the first 'unsupervised' visit at the park last week mom was on opposite side of park smoking not even hanging out with children.Thanks that felt great :-) hehe Good luck I know it's painful!  \n",
      "I completely understand what you are feeling. I am quickly learning you can't trust any body and do the best you can to do all communication through e-mail. I even have taken it as far as to reiterate a conversation through e-mail if the CW or someone happens to call by telephone. I feel no one has my best insterest or the children's for that matter at hand. I am a pretty trusting person, but through this I have learned you have to be careful with everyone when it comes to being a foster parent. Good luck and I hope it all works our I know it can be extremely frustrating.  \n",
      "We are in the same position as you, we took in my niece and nephew almost a year ago now. Both call us by our names or auntie and uncle. My niece (6) never makes the mistake of calling us mom or dad. But my nephew (4) often will joke and call us mommy and/or daddy. We will joke back with him and say 'you're silly.' I personally don't feel 100% comfortable with them calling us mom and/or dad because we are still completely in line for RU and they do see their bios each week for a short amount of time. If we knew we were in line for adoption or if they point blank asked us or did it all the time I probably would not stop it. But I personally don't want to deal with the backlash of the bios nor do I want the children to be confused if/when they do go back. So I really think it is a personal call for both you and your nephew. Do what you feel right doing and what he seems most comfortable with. I wouldn't disuade it, but I definitely would not push it. Good Luck!  \n",
      "And the best part is it wasn't even by the bio parents this time.The CW wrote the other day saying she needed to do her visit this month with the kids. She wanted to do it at their new summer camp/day care. I requested if we could please do it at our home because it is right by the day care and we could meet at any time since the visits usually only last about 15 minutes. I requested this because my niece gets so embarassed when everyone keeps showing up at her school and all the kids ask her who these people are that stop in. And she's only been at the place a week and is trying to make new friends. I feel so bad for her.So anyhow. My niece gets home tonight and we are laying there just talking about her day and she says why did **** come to my school today? I said she did? And she said yeah she came at recess. Well that explained so much about the day and the attitude that came along with it. But I can't believe no body bothered to say a **** word. Why do I bother? No one cares about these children, why do I feel like I care too much and just keep getting screwed!?Vent over... :-p  \n",
      "@Crazy_Woman - I am thinking you may be right. Which I said in the e-mail if the HAVE to go to the school then they do and I get maybe not wanting to tell me ahead of time so I don't 'tell my niece to say something.' But they could at least have given me a courteous e-mail/call after the fact so I knew what I may or may not be dealing with last night with emotions. Who knows what the bios are saying, I am certain they've prob. made me out to be the bad guy. But you would think the CW's could see through that. Let's remind ourselves whose kids got taken, it wasn't mine....And anyone who met these children, me or came to our home would see how much they are loved...But let me remind you this CW has only been on our case like 3 months and has not met any of us except the bios. And the monthly visits have not been by her, but by people working with her...so that says something right there IMHO.  \n",
      "I hope the judge does as well... I don't know if there is anyone higher up, but it may be time to find out. On the other hand I also am thinking I may just sit back and let this play out because they are loading the bios up with more visitation time and honestly if the past is any indication of the future it will all blow up soon...or maybe they will get it together and shock us all! I want to do what's best but if RU if still the goal I feel like maybe right now i need to leave everything else aside and enjoy the time I have with my niece and nephew and teach them all I can, in case they go back...  \n",
      "If the parents miss in our case I don't let there be a makeup. I adjust my life too much as it is for these visits and don't feel its my responsibility to accomodate another day because they cancelled. Now if I cancel a visit (which only happened once in almost a year) I do work hard to make a makeup visit occur, it's only fair IMO.  \n",
      "That's so wonderful to hear...I do think there is parents out there who get into a tough spot, but they fix what they have to and get their children back. And I truly hope this mother keeps it up!!! I can definitely have respect for that. This is the one thing I wish for everyday with my niece and nephew's parents, them to do anything, just anything to show their children that they care and WANT them back...I don't think I have truly felt that at any point and in our case and that is what makes me so upset.  \n",
      "In your experience... We have had one supervised visit a week for an hour and a half for just over the last 10 months. Court is coming up in about 2 months. At this point they are really bulking up the visit schedule...We are still apparently in line for RU. In your experiences, how does it go when parents have had almost no visitation to a fair amount? I am imagining in our case it may not go well. Is this normal to do before a 12 month review hearing. Especially if they are trying to get a 6 month extension because they don't yet have housing? The CW has said that the 6 month extension will prob. happen, but how will it look to a judge? Just wondering what your experiences were with this. I think the kids truthfully will not be happy when they find out where they may be living and all the visits they will soon have to do, but maybe I will be wrong...  \n",
      "Thank you everyone for the feed back. I am believing it's a sink of swim motive as well. They are upping visits by three hours unsupervised at a nearby park. Three hours!!! That's a long time at a park in my opinion, but who knows. They said they were from there going to quickly add on more supervised time as well at mother's place (she is trying to transition to a family shelter currently so bio dad can move in). I think if this works at all then they will extend at the 12 month review, but honestly I don't know if bios will be able to keep up more visits until the 12 month review. I just love that it's been almost 11 months and now we are piling all this, WTH, why didn't this happen sooner? They've been good at making almost 99% of current visitations, but it's only an hour and a half a week and both do nothing so I would hope they can make it. I guess only time will tell, but I think more visits will work for a matter of time and then blow up. I would love to be proven wrong though.... So close yet so far....  \n",
      "So the TDM recently occured, did anything good come of it, don't think so... I was unable to attend, bascically it was called because I was frustrated with bios and wasn't sure with the shennanigans if the kids could stay, although I want them to!! I posed some things I would like to change before the meeting, nothing crazy, and if that could occur kids could stay no problem!! Yipee. So, did any of that happen...nope! I was basically told afterwards that the kids are 100% in line for RU, that the case would be extended out to 18 months until parents are GIVEN housing and bascically if I didn't comply and wasn't 100% on board they were removing the kids. And complying means sitting down with my 'sister' (bio mom) and working out our difference...because by me not getting along with her I am putting stress on the children!!!!! FFFFFFFFFF that!!!! You don't think them being if foster care isn't stress? And I have been completely cordial and nice with both parents, it's them that isn't!!!! I said I won't sit down but of course I would continue to remain cordial, I would never say anything bad about bios in front of children and I would support reunification if it was deemed appropriate...The CW said she wasn't real comfortable with my answers and she is still considering moving them to a strangers home! Clearly caring too much is wrong! And on top of that it's fine for everyone not to care about what's best for the kids, but when I am worried about what is I get punished...WTF....well that aside the CW said she would call early this week about her decision and I still have not heard from her. Plus, she this CW was the fillin CW that I was recently told will just be our CW for the remainder of the case....SUPER! So anyhow, kids had visit last week. Parents are still hiding car at local parking lot. Spouse and I checked it out and it was HORRIBLY disgusting pretty convinced bio dad is living in it...I mean bad bad...not just 'Oh I have stuff' but like 'Oh I am disgusting and grimy' kinda dirty. Plus why does no one care he is hiding it still!!!!! But it's cool they are adding on an extra visit day and he will be picking them up now...SUPER! Well that's my vent. I hate the system and it seems so unfair to these children. If I actually felt like the parents have done anything that remotely showed they cared about their children or their well being I would be all for RU, but they haven't...In my opinion they only was their kids back because it gets them more handouts...ARRRRGGGGGGG!  \n",
      "I don't seem to really keep track either. There typically is a bit left over each month, but I typically will transfer that to a savings for birthday parties, school stuff, fun trips/outings etc. I think are bills went up a bit, gas especially, but it all kind of balances itself out. We do get day care covered though. If we didn't then it would be a different story. But I don't think you're wrong to take a little bit to supplement yourself for cost increases. I mean I was told at one point by a CW 'it's my job.' HAHAHAHA, if this is a job it's not even meeting the minimum wage guidelines!!! I just would take the first few months see how it all pans out and decide from there what works best for you all.  \n",
      "I'm so sorry for that poor little guy. And I completely agree, kids should not have to be that resilliant, that is what is so sad about how all this works. At the end of the day in most cases it seems like the kids just get punished for their parents mistakes, and it shouldn't work that way. And I completely agree with your statement that a real parent, mom or dad swallows their pride and does what's right for their kids. Good luck to you all...I hope it all works out in the best way possible for him.  \n",
      "I love some of the ideas people have! Have you also tried the site pinterest. Has wonderful ideas for everything. Have got numerous craft projects and gift ideas from here, so you may be able to find catepillar ideas as well!  \n",
      "My sister just forwarded me this link a friend of her's posted about how her FD's will be going home soon so she created a bucket list of things she wants to make sure to do/teach them before they return home... Really got me thinking and I loved the idea (Thanks for the idea if this friend is on this blog :-) Anyhow, I know it's different for all ages, but what are somethings you would want your foster childrento know or do before they returned to their bios? My condesed list... 1. Take a 'family photo' 2. How to call 911 3. It's okay to tell someone if there is something bad happening, who could be there safe people...(teachers, therapists, coaches, law enforcement etc.) 4. How to care for themselves (bathe, brush teeth, use potty, etc.) 5. How to make some easy meals (pp&j, mac and cheese, boil eggs, basic microwave info) 6. That they are awesome and can be anything they want to be if they work at it, no one can dictate their future 7. For my niece, that a guy should treat you like a princess, leave them if they call names, hit etc. no one can force you to do things you don't want to or feel comfortable doing. 8. For my nephew, how to be a true gentelman, also they don't have to stay with anyone that doesn't treat them amazing. 9. Confidence 10. Take them to the aquarium, amusement parks, family gatherings, celebrate holidays big 11. Show them what love is, and why they deserve so much of it. 12. Make sure they know they always come 'home' 13. Don't let them forget how much we love them and always will and NONE of this is their fault My list goes on and on... What's some of your bucket list items with your kids?  \n",
      "irq11This is a great idea, but -- lifechanges, was it really your sister who sent you that link? I hope not, because it seems awfully presumptuous for her to tell you to make a list of stuff to teach her kids before sending them back to her. Hehe valid point, other sister sent it! ;-)  \n",
      "We are doing kinship placement in CA. We have been completely kept in the dark in regards to everything. Is there a way to get more information about what is in the file?  \n",
      "Are you living my life? We are over 10 months in and I still don't know what the case goal is...I'm thinking RU, but have NO CLUE! I've called, i've e-mailed and rarely do I get a reponse, yet bio mom (my sister) says she talks to the CW all the time (lie, I don't know?) Anyhow, you are not alone and if your case is anything like ours you'll have 5 diff. CW's. We had one filling in for ours (wasn't even told) for about 3 months, then just heard that our original one 'well she's just not coming back' after 8 months! WTH!!!! Good luck and I am sorry you are in that position because I know it's frustrating and can make you look bad to people when it truly isn't your fault.  \n",
      "I don't know what I would do, that is horrible. Here is maybe an idea off the top of my head. Maybe buy a second set of what she needs to have for visits, at least items that you can, change of clothes, sippy cups etc. Tell the CW to come pick it up and bring it to bio mom. From there say I have provided it and if she chooses to dispose/loose it then it is up to her to replace it. On items like diapers, wipes, food, I would send with her the amount you feel is needed, maybe one or two extras and send that each visits. Just a thought...that way the CW can see you provided it and if she needs new stuff she needs to give the CW a list and the CW should give to you. That way they can see she is needing new things each visit that should truly last for awhile.  \n",
      "Affection when anyone is around doesn't bother me, but it's my niece and nephew so my situation is a bit different. The only thing that did make me a bit uncomfortable the other day was the children's new therapist was over for a visit, while she was playing with my niece I was keeping my nephew occupied and my nephew kept saying 'Mama Mama' to me. This is not something he calls me so it was a bit akward for him to say it when the therapist was there. Then he wouldn't stop, he thought it was funny. I just looked at him and said you're so silly....and moved on. But other than that time if they have an issue with being affectionate with the kids (in a completely appropriate manner of course) than I am probably not the home for them.  \n",
      ":grr: I believe I have seen this question posed on here. I am sure there is probably not much I can do, but my question is who do you write in regards to how messed up the system is, at least her in Cali? I am truly starting to believe no one has the best interests of my niece or nephew at hand, or us as foster parents, and its disgusting and sad. I am just wondering is there someone we can even write here in California in regards to this? Again, i'm not expecting much of a response, but it's worth a try. I just keep questioning different things, 1. Why after almost a year do we do still have only one supervised hour and a half a week, when do we quit taking little steps and dive in head first and see whether or not bio's can be parents or not? 2. At what point will we stop helping the parents, who in my case clearly don't' want to be helped, just everything handed to them, and actually do what's best for these children. 3. As they get older and older, what if we decide we can't adopt, if it came to that, what if they are older and not as adoptable. We are more than willing at this point, but how long must we wait? 4. Why are no services provided for the kids, but then once we raise a little hell they start putting them in place almost 10 months later. 5. When are they just going to offer these kids permanency. They are too young to stand up for themselves and I feel like I am the only one trying to do what's best, whether they stay or return home. Not even their parent's are tyring is the saddest part. 6. Why would bio parents not be required to bring ANYTHING to a visit? Isn't that their time to be parents, why do I have to provide everything. But most importantly when will the system get their heads out of their butts and do what their name says, Protect Children. This isn't Parent protection, they're old enough to make their own choices. It's time to actually start considering the kids.  \n",
      "Sure sounds like you are living my life, you're just a bit further down the road. I have no idea what I would do if it came to TPR. What I think I would do, probably take at least a 6 month to 1 year break from seeing parents completely and let us bond more as a 'family' without all the other drama involved. From there I would see how it goes. I agree I wouldn't want my kids to feel that they're missing out on some 'glamor' life with their bio parents, but at the same it's my job to protect them and allow them to see their parents as they choose, I feel my job is to let them be kids as long as possible and not worry about all this crap. After the 6 months to a year I think I would consider a visit, maybe once every three months or so or may I would not consider them at all, but let my kids decide as they get older what they would want to do...Truthfully it's really tough to say...I think you are going to question no matter what way you chose. I think do what's best for you, your nephew and the situation, go with your gut as he gets older maybe you can change things as fit, if necessary. Good luck, but if I've learned anything you have to protect yourself and your nephew and do what's best for you guys...  \n",
      "So we are still completely up in the air on our situation and if we will move the kids or not. Realistically I don't know if I have it in me to move them, especially when we have such great days and they really aren't the problem, at all. The CW is coming by today for her monthly visit. I have received no contact from her since I called to say we want to disrupt. I am nervous how it will go and what she will say. Is there anything I should specifically ask her or say you think? I took it upon myself last week to call the visitation supervisor and he will now be bringing the kids home after visits, yah! He can be the bad guy. I am not sure what else we can change to make it better... Maybe some sort of answers will help! Court is in just over 2 months! Ugghhhh.  \n",
      "@ foster2forever - this is a great idea, I am working on it right now. I did A B and C - must have, would like to have, deal breakers. Really I am not sure what to even put on the list though, I want transporation from visits, would prefer to as well. Bios need to bring food and necessities to visit. We want no contact with bios unless an emergency. Deal breaker is if parents continue to harrass/accuse us of things, continue to hint to kids they're going back and if day care is not paid for.  \n",
      "Well, the CW just emailed...and cancelled. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I am so frustrated! I changed the whole day around so the kids therapist would come to our house I could get off work early. Such a JOKE! And then she had the decency to ask for the kids day care address and time they would both be there. The older one doesn't go and you have the address!!!! I am officially pissed!  \n",
      "My nephew (FS) just turned 4 and has many of the same qualities yours has. I to love that he is so spirited and does have a strong head on his shoulders, but....he needs to learn to balance that. 10 months in and here's what we have found. If you say you're going to do it, DO IT! You don't eat dinner, no dessert, you yell at me again you go to your room, you don't look for cars of pay attention on your bike it goes up. No matter what you do, DON'T GIVE IN! Our little guy rarely takes naps, he is in bed by 7:30, this was tough at first but after a couple weeks of consitency it is not a problem what so ever now. I have found that you have to keep them active through out the day. Do relay races outside, bike riding, scooters, take the dog on a walk. Anything to wear them out. We do 30 min to 60 min outside depending on day and then we do some quite time games inside and move it back outside again. He now does soccer once a week and is about to start swimming lessons once a week. Tire them out!! Choices, even if they are ridiculous let them make the decisions. You want to put on your socks or shirt first, potty before or after we eat, brush your teeth or comb your hair. Seems ridiculous but it works. We are currently working with our little guy on concentration and not being the center of attention as well. We are trying to do a couple of worksheets a day to get him ready for school. Also, we really have to try hard not to give in to his attention silly moods sometimes. We have told him there is a time for silly and a time for serious. We aren't there yet, but practice makes perfect! These were a few tips I learned on here as well as through trial and error, maybe it isn't right, but so far it's working for us! Good luck!  \n",
      "This may be pretty close to the top of one of the hardest days of my life...Nothing is official, but I put in the call to have the kids removed. I requested it be postponed until after school is complete in a couple of week. CW said nothing except ok I will get on that. Apparently she is setting up a TDM. I'm not really sure what that means, she was talking to her supervisor and calling me back...We are able to rescind our decision. Nothing has been said to the children. I feel horrible, but honestly I feel horrible for my 3 year old newphew. He LOVES living with us, he loves us and he is such 'our' kid. My niece, well I don't think she will really care either way, except she may when she knows that she still isn't going back with mom and dad but maybe a strangers house... UUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH! So lost and confused.  \n",
      "Thank you all for the kind words...It's nice to have people that understand. We have no word still from the CW, last we heard she is scheduling a TDM. We for sure have 2 weeks before any changes, because I said i want to make sure my niece finishes school. So anything can change between now and then. And frankly I am hoping it will, maybe as some of you said this will get everyone in a tailspin and they will actually start doing something and not just letting this drag. My niece is 6 nephew just turned 4. My aunt, bascially their grandma, talked to my niece yesterday. Used a great analogy about her favorite animal and basically explained that her parents weren't doing the best they could and I was asked to give them a good home until they completed their tasks. My niece I believe understood and was very apologetic to me last night. I know she loves me and cares and I can only imagine how she must be feeling. Where am I at this morning. Confused, very confused. I don't want to send them to a 'strangers' home. I want to make this work, but on the other hand agree that maybe removing them would make bio mom and dad open their eyes. I am looking at ways to make sure we are completely removed from every situation involving bio mom and dad. I can't go down with some sort of fight, I love both my niece and nephew too much. And of course last night was prob. one of our best nights with the kids. Why does that always seem to happen??? But those are the nights that make me remember why I am where I am. I get to enjoy those two smiles and laughs... UGHHHH!  \n",
      "I think I've met my breaking point and I am considering having the kids removed. I know most you know my story, kinship placement, not a foster parent by choice. This evening was VERY tough on me...Visitation night, simply went to pick up the children and had my wonderful spouse get out of the car to get them. Bio dad approached my spouse in front of the therapist and bio mom to tell him they were coming to open house at school. They haven't been involved one day, why are they coming!!! None of us get along. I am the one that drive 40 miles everyday to take her to school, the one we kept her at so she could have stability! So what was my spouse suppose to say?The visit went 20 minutes over visit time as parents coddled the children. The visitation supervisor watched, did nothing. Kids finally got in car both crying, finally my niece says it's all my fault and I'm making it all this way. And that's it, she hit the spot! I said do you really think that? So I opened the door while bio's and therapist were standing there and said 'She thinks it's all my fault, do one of you want to tell her the REAL situation?' Bio mom (my sister, barfing as I use that word) looked and so innocently said 'Well of course it's no one's fault.' I got in the car and shut the door. I then spent 30 minutes hearing how horrible I was. I honestly don't think I can take any more. Bio mom and dad are playing us HUGE and it's a joke! Truly my niece and nephew blaming us if this does become permanent is one of my biggest fears. How will we ever be a real family? We can't and this just confirmed it, we are going to be the bad guys. Then to think when we have kids, what will my niece and nephew tell them, how horrible we are? Then to end the evening I said hey well mom and dad are coming to your open house tomorrow, she was so excited. I told her I wasn't going to go. She just said 'ok.' Why am I even wasting my time!!!!!? So in other words I think it may be time to find them a new home. I don't think we can be their permanent home if it comes to it and I don't know if i can keep doing it if they're simply going back. I care too much I think and I'm the one getting hurt.  \n",
      "Thank you all for your responses, it sounds like you all are saying the same thing I am thinking at this point. I don't know what I would do without being able to use this board. I was up all night, couldn't sleep a wink. The thought of it sucks soooo bad, but I think it may be time. Things aren't getting better if anything they have got worse and to have the kids blaming me to hurts so badly. The only thing I have tried to do is the right thing, but I am starting to question what the right thing even is anymore. I should have listened to EVERYONE in my family when they said don't take this on, you know your sister she is 'poison'. I thought no there are 2 kids, I can change it I can make it better. For once in my life I think I'm going to have to admit that maybe I can't change it or make it better. I've done the best I've could with the hand I was dealt and it's unfortunate it's 2 kids that get the **** end of the deal. I have a call in to the CW, haven't yet heard back, didn't say to much just to please call me. I am thinking if we go through with it we will tell the CW to start looking for a family but we want to wait a couple of more weeks until school is done and also give ourselves sometime to really process this and make sure we are making the right move. I FEEL HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!  \n",
      "Very concerning. I feel like I would probably tell the CW, but I hear your concerns, but safety wise it may be the right thing to do. If they have to move him maybe it could simply be temporary until you find out what's going on? Have you considered putting up a video camera like one you already have in the window or purchasing some small ones to hide in front of the house. Did you get the make of the car or could you describe it. The cops may be able to figure it out even with part of the license plate, make model and color? Is there a particular time of day you are seeing this person, if so maybe the cops can do some drive bys around that time? I wish you all the best in this and hope you get an answer real soon.  \n",
      "So we aren't new to not receiving a response from our CW. They rarely return our call, and I can't say we call all that often. We currently have a fill in CW and have for about 2 months. She was very good, getting some stuff moving, but now it's at a complete stand still. I have called three times and e-mailed 4 times in the last 2.5 weeks, because she was looking into some somewhat urgent stuff for us, but never followed up? Bio mom (my sis) says she has had a lot of contact with her (I don't know if this is true or not?)? I don't know how else to get ahold of the CW and to get her to do what we need her to....It's soooo frustrating. Do you all experience this? And how do you handle? I'm not sure if this is normal or because we are a kinship placement? Also, we are 2 months away from our 12 month hearing, what's all of your experience on hearing where the case is at? We are completely in the dark, I don't even no if the case is still RU, concurrent or going towards TPR. Bio mom says they may TPR, when do you suppose they will mention this to us with a straight answer? Any advice or BTDT? Also, why it's on my mind, for visits...do you all supply what's needed or are the bio parents responsible for that? My kiddos meet with their parents at the park and I give them dinner, water bottles and change of clothes, sunscreen and towels (because their is a water portion). But I am kinda of feeling like if they are going to do parenting they could at least do it for their 1 hour and a half visit a week??  \n",
      "Thank you for the responses. I agree about the visits. Frankly I don't even like to refer to her as my sister at this point, but she is...unfortunately. But I agree she should be a parent even if it's for an hour an a half. Now to get ahold of this dang case worker! :-)  \n",
      "Oh I know, we are 10 months in and still battling it at times, we finally just got the one and one therapy setup and I am excited to see if it helps! Good luck with your situation.  \n",
      "Recently my niece (FD), in the last month or so has been almost distant from us. She definitely seems like she no longer wants to live with us and would prefer just to go back to her mom and dad. You simply mention her mom or dad recently and she becomes VERY defensive, which really we have never talked badly or disrespectful about them in front of her so I'm not sure why this is coming up? Now I think they may have told her a few things about us recently or about living with us, not positive, but almost certain, that is making her question things. I'm just not sure how to handle it. I mean I think she is happy with us, but I think she would be just as happy with her parents, she is a lot like them. I want to be there for her, but it's been very hard recently when we constantly feel like the bad guys. Mom and Dad do NOTHING wrong at this point, in her eyes. And the way she is acting towards us is being seen by her little brother and he is beginning to pick up on it. Sometimes I think maybe it would just be easier if they went back, I am scared that even if they did TPR that the kids really may never be happy with us and how does that work into having kids of our own one day. I know they love us, but we aren't their parents...  \n",
      "Well if that is the case I am sooo glad she feels safe with me, but boy being the 'safe' parent sucks!! :-/  \n",
      "I just would tell my niece that mom and/or dad were working on getting better so that they can take care of you, but they do love you very much. We also got them special stuffies of their favorite things, one loves cats and one a cartoon movie charachter, we also let them both pick out their favorite books to read before bed and talk about the fun things we will be doing in the upcoming days or the good memories from the day we just had.  \n",
      "They are normal...I'm in a bit of a different situation, but my spouse and I have been on our own for almost 9 years before my niece and nephew were placed with us. I definitely have those days where I just want it to be me and him again...everything is always about kids! I know for myself that we still are looking for that balance of having time to ourselves, but unfortunately our family doesn't love the idea that we took on my niece and nephew and aren't super supportive, I also feel bad asking for someone to watch them...Sometimes I wonder if it would feel different if we were just able to adopt them...I know that's not much help, but I guess what I am saying is you aren't alone with your feelings. :-)  \n",
      "BoysParent I can add that I had a pretty \"colorful\" conversation with biomom last night though. I figured I had nothing to lose, so I told her that because of people like her cheating the system her kids now face going back to the childrens holding institution downtown. Of course, she tried to argue with me that she had a job \"helping a friend\" when she was getting her preschool paid for. We also had a heated conversation about how she is an idiot for believing it is better for the kids to be in the institution versus staying with an aunt she doesn't like. Here she is STILL frivolously spending our tax dollars to server her personal agendas. No wonder the state of California is broke off it's butt. So frustrating. These poor kids. Sorry, I'm just a little bitter right now. You have every right to be bitter. I have had these same conversations with my bio sister and the bio dad, and people like this don't care...all they care about is them selves, words do/mean nothing to them...And when it comes to their children, all they truly care about is will it get them more money or not, IMHO? In our case I don't think they truly wants what's best for their kids, if they didn't they wouldn't be excited to get them back to put them in a shelter. My sister's exact quote to me in a random e-mail last week was 'I will be ****ed if they take OUR kids because we are poor.' CPS doesn't take your kids because you're poor, they take your kids because you are sucky parents who think of no one but yourselves.  \n",
      "BoysParent I'm am so **** angry at the agency right now. They do EVERYTHING for these BPs but treat us like crap. Amen! I'm so sorry you are going through this, it really is not fair.  \n",
      "I think I would report it, but finding the right way is what is tricky... Like the PP said maybe don't do something completely formal, but more casual, maybe play dumb a little bit. Like was I suppose to give you a car seat for transporting or should mom be providing that?It seems CRAZY to me a CW would make that move. I know the law just past that a kid should be in a boosters up until the age of 8, at least in CA. So a 2 year old should definitely be...sometimes I question where some of these CW's came from...Sometimes I joke with my sig. other that it seems like they were the parents of some of these kids in FC that were then handed these jobs...Maybe that is harsh, but it seems so true some times, at least IMO. And that's not to say there aren't good ones out there, but with as many as we have gone through I have had our fair share of not so good ones.  \n",
      "So I am receiving emails from bio mom (my sister) pretty regularly, in my opinion it's trying to justify to me that she is no longer mentally ill and bio dad isn't still a huge looser. My question is, how much does each person who is involved play in the case. She keeps talking that therapist says she's doing great and would be a great parent etc., (I have no idea if this is true or not) but the therapist has never even met the children how could they decide whether or not she would be a decent parent? Also the visitation therapist voiced often to me that my concerns on bios were valid and correct but my sister claims he was telling her she and bio dad were doing great. Do therapists in your experience have an impact on the permanency of the children? Have you experienced them telling bios one things and you another or does it sounds more like bio parents wishful thinking? I'm just confused so many different people do many different stories, who do you believe, who do you trust, who besides the judge plays the biggest part? Do judges often go with recommendation or no? We have exactly 3 months to our 12 month review still only hour and half visits per week parents are quickly trying to get into a family shelter... Doesn't look good to me but who am I to say...  \n",
      "URmysunshine4Well in my current FD case, mom is an addict, and depending on her mood can be very sweet or very sour, but always manipulates the situation wherever she can. From what our CW has told us everyone (CASA, GAL, CW, DRs & lawyers) in our case writes a review and the judge reads it and makes his decision based on what he reads. Okay, that's kind of what I thought, but I wonder what happens if there is conflicting reviews? My sister and bio dad are such manipulators and scammers, I don't trust anything they say. My sister is said to be mentally ill, which I still don't know I fully believe, I think she is trying for more funding, but may be wrong. But I know they will do/say pretty much anything they have to, to get their way and can put on a pretty convincing show at times. It worries me that those involved won't care enough to see through the lies. I know they see them, but the question is will they care enough to address them is the issue.  \n",
      "BoysParentFrom my experience, trust nobody. I know biomom is your sister, but she is going to tell you what you want to hear. The CW's goal is RU and if she thinks for a second you don't support RU, she will lie to you. As for the therapists, the only way they get paid is by being hired by the CW's/CPS, so they are bias. We experienced first hand that the therapists will know a BP is not good for parenting, but they won't put that in their reports. They go along with what the CW wants to see in the reports. Oh I don't trust anyone, my sister first and foremost. But what I am now wondering is why are CW's so for RU? What's it matter to them if children go home or don't? I mean if they know that the situation they are going back to truly isn't healthy and see that they are thriving where they currently are, why do they want to RU so badly? I mean I'm just curious because it seems like it would be more work to send them back monitor how everything is going, continue to help bio parents, and more than likely have to take the kids back in to custody and then find them somewhere to live. I mean sad to say it but we prob. would not speak up again if my niece and nephew go back and end up back in FC unfortunately I think it will be an ongoing battle in and out because their parents don't really care.  \n",
      "Your case sounds just like ours! We are aunt and uncle biologically as well. My nephew (3) will sometimes call us mom and dad being silly, but sometimes I think he would actually like to call us that. I just say you're silly who am I...He then says I am silly your auntie. My niece, calls me aunt... as well, but jokes around at times that I am 'pretend mom'. We aren't to the point of TPR yet so I don't know that I am 100% comfortable with being called that yet, I would love to say okay, but I believe my sister would be enraged as well, plus I don't want to confuse the kids. If they came out and asked us I would probably say it was okay though... so if I was you and where you are at in the case and my nephew asked me I'd probably say if you would like to you can and see where it goes... Good luck!! :-)  \n",
      "We have a fill in CW for about a month and so far she is AMAZING!!!! I even went as far as to ask her if I could contact her if I need something after our actual CW comes back...she said Yes!!! So 9.5 months later and visits are out of our house!, we have got the kids setup with a one on one therapist!, we have a therapist that will monitor the visit so we don't have to stay any more!!!!!, she got day care funding renewed! Yeah Yeah Yeah! I'm so happy...my bio sis and her wonderful BF (I say that completely jokingly) will soon be out of our lives, at least as much as possible being that we are caring for their children... :-) Thank you AMAZING fill in CW, at least someone is finally listening!!!!  \n",
      "I honestly don't remember much back before about 1st grade, so that's like 6ish, even then it's still a bit blurry. I wonder that sometimes as well, my niece is 6 and nephew almost 4, I think they will remember living with us if they go back but maybe not the details. It's strange though my 6 year old niece remembers quite a bit, but at times she makes up quite a bit about her life before living with us. I have been around her all her life so I know a lot of what's true or not, but it's kind of sad that she's almost made up a good life in regards to her past... it's very interesting how the mind works...  \n",
      "I just called today after 9.5 months to find out what disruption would mean in our case, what sucks is it really has nothing to do with my niece and nephew but instead their parents (my sister and her bf) who are trying to turn our lives into a living hell! They at this point are calling and bad mouthing me to the CW and I've done nothing, I think honestly they are doing pretty much anything they can at this point. The CW proceeded to call me and let me know and it was literally all made up. I was extremely heated because I only took on these kids because I love them and thought it would be best, not because I had to or even necessarily wanted to in the beginning. The CW let me know I was not in trouble, my response... \"I know I'm not in trouble I didn't do a **** thing except try to be a good person, I've got nothing to loose, these are not my children, I have a good life, I didn't ask for this.\" now of course I do have the kids to loose that I love so deeply, but at the end of the day I won't put up with the BS, if they'd rather THEIR children in a foster home than with their aunt who adores them by all means please come get them and explain that one to them! So yes I do think your feelings are normal, I still have them, needless to say we are working very hard not to disrupt but I am coming VERY close.... :-( Good luck!  \n",
      "So this week alone I have been accused of being unresonable and blackmail. And I'm pretty sure in stealing children, in more words than less... I have been contacted by the SW to be told 'I'm not in trouble.' Why would I be in trouble, we are actually dealing with CRAZY people!!! I'm not doing fostering because I want to...I'm doing it because I think it's the right thing for my niece and nephew, but at this point I'm not sure it's right for me anymore... Visits are no longer in our house, but we still have to supervise, parents are now telling the kids bad stuff about us and manipulating them into thinking living with them will be good. At what point do you throw up your hands and say F it!!!? I didn't ask for this, I don't want this, at the end of the day it's bio parents that can explain why their kids are with strangers and not their aunt and uncle who they say they want to stay with forever! I guess the bigger question is at what point do I consider my feelings and know that this situation may never get better. Even if we had the kids permanently, which the case is still in reunification mode, but with the family dynamic will it ever get better or will I just constantly be in a living hell!? I wish sometimes I truly just didn't care or that I didn't have a mind telling me to do one thing over the other... Vent complete :-)  \n",
      "How sad, for you and your family...I would have done the same thing as you are doing... I do feel for the FD as clearly she was not brought up stable, but I wouldn't put up with it either. Hopefully the mom can get her life together and get her daughter back if that's clearly what they want so bad, or hopefully the FD learns that mom probably isn't her best option and stops making accusations on those trying to help her. Take care and hang in there!  \n",
      "That's awesome, I hope it continues!! We have a fill in CW right now and she has done more for us in the last 2 weeks then our actual CW has done in the last 9 months!! I've been so excited...I even went as far as to ask her when our CW gets back can I still call/email her if I have a question about something or if something is not getting done... she said yes!!!!  \n",
      "I'm sorry you are having to go through this. I am a kinship placement as well and I completely concur with the emotions you are having. In our case the parents are in the picture and having visitations, but just not doing what they need to get their lives in order and it's been 9.5 months, it makes me sick. How would you not want to get your children back right away! In our case at this point I do not think it would be in the best interest for my niece and nephew to go back. If the parents were getting their lives together i would be all for it, I would love to have my own life and to see them back and happy with their parents... It is a tough situation and I am sort of where you are that adoption is final if it came down to it, no changing and wanting your kids back at that point...now to keep a relationship, I don't know how that is possible, I can't even look them in the eyes as they have turned are lives into a living hell any chance they get. I would think that in time I would probably let the children make the choice to see them or not... It's tough, and I wouldn't wish this upon anybody. Hang in there, I am sure the right answer will come along. I don't personally have children of my own yet, but I have said multiple times that I am glad because I would never want to take my children through the drama of all of this, it's so hard with visitations, bio parents, CW visits, therapy visits etc. So in your case as much as you may love your little cousin I would definitely consider your own young one and how this will effect them. Truthfully...but again I do not have children of my own so I can't speak from experience on that, just thoughts I personally have had.  \n",
      "I don't know if I would believe anything from bios until you actually hear it from the CW. Bios in our case are actually related so I didn't think they would lie, but almost everything they say is made up or exaggerated. They recently just told me there was an additional weekend visit, I contacted the CW and she said that's strage they said that I told them no....so just be careful what you believe from bios, they may be telling the truth, but I would wait to hear it out of CPS's mouths.  \n",
      "Congrats!!! That must be so exciting for you all!  \n",
      "Congrats! That is so exciting! :-)  \n",
      "I feel so in the dark when it comes to my niece and nephews case. I also have a very 'need to know personality.' So the whole situation drives me crazy. And even when I do feel like we find something out we are getting conflicting answers. We had a person from a specialized CPS unit not to long ago who was asking us about adoption and such and saying with mom's mental state it will be 'shocking' if she gets them back. Now we have a fill in CW and she is saying don't be surprised if they go back....Ugghhh I hate it. I want to prepare myself as well as them for what's gonna happen next. GIVE ME A STRAIGHT ANSWER!!! hehe Good luck with your case.  \n",
      "Your little guy sounds an awful lot like our soon to be 4 year old. Minus the dog part. We have just tried to be extremely consistent and we now put him in his room, for the 3 minutes (his age) and if necessary hold the handle. We tried time outs else where but he gets up and runs around and laughs or would run up and hit or act like he was hitting, so this tactic has worked best. Whether it's right or not...well I don't know. We do try to praise him often, but sometimes he just needs a good old fashion time out becasue he knows how to push buttons and is EXTREMELY strong willed. We have requested a therapist from our CW to come to talk with him/play (if it ever gets setup) because clearly he's going through a lot. Great little guy for the most part I must say, but when he gets into a mood he's in it. I have noticed more recently as well our little guy came to live with us at 3 not really getting it, it has been over 9 months and I see him beginning to question and understand (in a 3/4 year old manner) more of what's going on so I find visits and the day after really mess with him. Wets himself, bit me during a visit, and just overall seems angry around visit/talking to mom and/or dad. So we have tried to find other ways to help him deal with his emoitions. Hope it works out for you.  \n",
      "Poor Kid. I don't have any advice for you, but I sympathize for him/her and you. That must be so tough. This is such a fear of mine if my niece and nephew return home. Good luck with it all.  \n",
      "Ours use to say fish but it sounded like b** ch, it was very funny because you never knew. Now he says holy poop, are you kidding me?, that's a good deal, haha the list goes on an on he cracks us up! I love it!  \n",
      "So last week was a bit of a tough week for us. Nephew had lots of accidents, out of the blue mentioned about moving back with mom and dad. Niece was doing the same thing and we really weren't sure what was going on... Well we figured it out, bio mom (sister) started e-mailing me that she wanted weekends, I said no as did CW, well then she proceeds to tell me she has been telling the kids they are coming back with her and will continue to, has even been telling my niece she has cats now (niece lives for cats). Well she doesn't have cats, they're stray and she won't even be living in the same shelter if the kids go back. It's sick she is doing this, but makes since what was going on now. She also says the reason they are acting out is because they want to be back with their parents and not stay with us...HAHAH HAHAHAHAHA...that's weird since they NEVER EVEN MENTION YOU! Her e-mails not only included that but went on how to talk about they're poor people and CPS takes poor peoples kids and she's not going to have that and she'll never give them what rich kids have blah blah blah... Such a pity party, clearly nothing about her has changed. CPS took your kids because your mentally unstable, bio dad is a drunk and you left them on my doorstep. Let's get real here... I really hope CPS sees what's going on and considers these poor kids, at this point whether they stay with me or someone else I sure as hell hope they don't go back to them. It's going to ruin these poor children....Grrrrrr....  \n",
      "We have not been down this road yet, but it is a question I asked my CW about here in CA and she said they same as the PP. They would have to have seperated residences and could not be living together or the one working the plan could not get the children back. I was also told after post RU if the CW finds the parents lving together or the one parent is often coming over that the kids would again be removed.  \n",
      "So I just went in to sign the agreement to extend the agreement for day care to be paid for for my niece & nephew (FS & FD). Something was then brought to my attention and that was the proposed budget cuts for day care in CA. Now I don't know too much on the topic yet, but the first thing that comes to mind is if it does happen and we don't receive funding, how can we afford to continue to take care of them. Horrible, but I've always said we are doing this because it's the right thing, but we can't afford to drain our bank accounts to be able to keep them with us. Second and more important question is, if there is budget cuts happening for day care funding for FP's, why did my sister (bio mother) just get setup with an apartment by the government (for 10% of her welfare income), why does she get free medical, why don't they check the apartment and see bio dad is living there (when he can't be, for FREE), why do they give her welfare and food stamps and unemployment (for her mentally disabled son, who isn't AT ALLLLLLL, he HAD a cleft pallet)? Why is she getting off doing nothing having no job not taking care of her children with all this help from the government, when we are faced with the reality that we are trying to do what is the right thing for her children and funding may be cut off for day care? I get it hasn't been yet, but the fact it's on the table to be reviewed is CRAZY talk! Especially for us FP's. This could be what decides if we can continue to care for the kids, we work full time and do college full time, just bought our first home and the monthly stipen would cover only about 75%, which means we would be out of pocket the difference plus just regular living costs. Again, I am not Super knowlegable in regards to this yet, but what I heard today and the little I read just got me questioning our system.  \n",
      "BoysParentWe are in the same boat as you are. We are in CA and have a sib group of two. We both work full time and the kids need to be in preschool. I just found out today that these kids are going to be with us at least 6 months. I had to tell the SW that she either get us the preschool funding or she is going to have to disrupt the placement. Well, that did it. She went in front of the judge today who ORDERED we get the daycare funding so that the kids do not get moved. I sure as hell hope that it was my call and not the judge's order that will get us the funding. Here's another note that will probably tick you off even more. Our current biomom got free daycare funding when she had the kids. Guess what. She forged a fake employers signature on the documents and nobody from the organization ever called to verify she was really working. She was dropping them off every morning at the daycare facility then going and hanging out with friends all day. We know of another biomom who is doing the same thing. If you are really struggling financially, you may need to tell your SW \"get the funding or get the kids moved\". You're last comment sounds like something my sis (bio mom) would do as well, whatever it takes to get a free handout, right? We are not struggling at this point, but if day care funds to get turned off it will be very tight, and it's not worth risking my financial future for kids who will prob. eventually go back, the fact I'm even saying that makes me sick, but it's the fact of the matter. The kids won't be any better off with me if we can't afford it, nor would I be happy. It just sucks because they are my niece and nephew and I love them whole heartedly and I hate for money to be an issue. Now it's just wait and see and hope the state comes to there senses! But I may have to use your tactic if it comes to it, because we really could not do it and we have set up such a great home and family life with these children. It's just sick the government helps people like my sis. There are people who really need help and they try really hard to get back on their feet, there are people like FP's who are just trying to do the right thing (in most cases) but need a bit of extra support, then there are the lazy people who deserve to all be put on an island by themselves where they can just do nothing all day and work for nothing....IMHO :-)  \n",
      "Well I did get the paperwork to get them on the list for the state funding in case county stops, but my understanding it is a VERRRRYYY long list so don't hold my breath, at least I'm getting on the list though! But yes if you hear anything please let me know!! :-)  \n",
      "So as some of you read in a past post, bio parents requested more visitation time at the last court day, they got it, an additional 3 hours once a week, unsupervised. One week occured and they said they couldn't do it anymore. I just got a call from the fill in CW (ours is on leave) who is now saying bio mom is requesting all visits be moved to her new 'government supplied' apartment in a city about 30 min. away, plus wants a day each weekend. I told the CW absolutely not and I will disrupt if this takes place. They had the chance and blew it and why would we increase visits when the 12 month review is three months away and they still don't even have a place to live with the children. Her place now is because she is 'mentally ill' with a 'mentally ill' roommate and does not allow kids. Let me mind you all this is my bio sister and niece and nephew. I love my niece and nephew to pieces and I am trying to do what's best, I hate to even mention the word disruption. But this is such a manipulative game my sister is playing and I can't let her continue and watch her children suffer through it. It's breaking my heart as well as driving me mad!  \n",
      "Thank you for your words of encouragement, this is how I need to look at it, it's just hard sometimes. The CW wrote back and said she won't be increasing visits at this point because of stuff she saw in the file, but basically warned me that the lawyer would argue that at her place there is a room for the children to visit so it should be allowed, plus basically warned me that they are looking for the right time to send them back. It makes me sick to even hear that, they'd be going to a shelter for the mentally ill, when they are in a perfectly stable home. It's sad to say but if they go back it will only be a matter of time....What is crazy is how the bio parents lawyer can really have any say as to what's best for the kids, first off they've never even met the kids or seen how the interact with their parents, plus do they truly have the best interest of anyone in mind or just needing to win their case? @just-breath - I hope your situation works out for the best.  \n",
      "just-breatheThanks! I think the one thing we focus on is what is best for the kids, when in reality, it's not about the kids. It's about protecting the parents' rights to parent their kids. Frustrates me to no end. I agree with you 100% on this statement. Why is so much time spent helping/protecting parents rights when it's their children suffering and they didn't protect/help them the way they should have. It infuriates me as well. I know my sister to well to know that she isn't doing what's best for them, she's being selfish and doesn't care what's best for them, only herself...This is why our system is so messed up. But if we just pretend it's not happening then it will all go away right? At least that how it seems like our case is being viewed. I 100% would love for my niece and nephew to go home to their parents and be safe and protected and loved and cared for, but the fact of the matter is the parents have done NOTHING to get to that point...I guess the question I keep asking myself is how is it that I can turn my life upside down and care so much for children that are not biologically mine, but their parents can't even make it for a visit or back to school night or a soccer game? I know I'll never get it....  \n",
      "That's so wonderful to hear. Sounds like the poor guy just needed to know he for sure had his 'forever family' I can't iomagine how that must feel for such a young child!  \n",
      "We asked this same question a few weeks back here in CA and they said yes bios will still get visits, they still are even able to work their plan and get the kids back after TPR is filed because they have 3 months until it goes to court, or longer to finalize. We were told basically that TPR is simply taking the steps to terminate that they still have their rights until it's officially terminated. Ridiculous in my opinion, I am kind of hoping we were given wrong information.... Good luck!  \n",
      "Longing2bMomI'm in California too. I was told that between the time that TPR is filed and the time it is actually granted (usually a minimum of 120 days), the bios can continue to work their caseplan; however, they are on their own with no help from social services. They must arrange and pay for everything themselves. Most bios won't do this. If they were not able to complete their plan with all the hand holding they get from social services prior to TPR filing, they are very unlikely to do it on their own afterwards. Even if they do complete their plan prior to TPR being granted, it is no guarantee that they will get the kids back because after TPR filing, focus shifts from \"parents working their plan\" to \"best interests of the child\". My son's bios did complete their plan prior to the TPR being granted, but it did them no good because the judge still ruled for TPR. It really surprised me because my son's bios were actually very good parents once you got past their hoarding habits. I was told that in my county, once TPR is filed, there is less than a 2% chance that it will not be granted. Here it is customary for visits to drop to one hour per month after TPR has been filed. After TPR has been granted, visits stop unless their is a post-adoption contact agreement in place. I believe that the OP said that TPR has already been granted in her case, so there ordinarily would be no visits. However, since she is just a temporary home before the child moves to a relative, she may have to live up to any post-adoption contact agreement that the relatives made, in which case there may still be visits. I would doubt it, though. Interesting, thank you for the further clarity... I hope this is the case, because it seems crazy that even after TPR is filed they can continue to work to get their children back. I do have to say I had a chuckle about the comment of focus shifting from 'parents working their plan' to 'best interest of children' it does seem like this is how it works. It's so sad IMHO, shouldn't the state look for the best interest of the children from the beginning? My nephew is currently going through so many emotions being that he is three and actually starting to understand (in a 3 year old way) what is happening. After 9 months and no action by the parents it seems crazy to just continue to put the children through these emotions. No child should have to go through this. Any how...thanks again for the information, this board has been so much more helpful in terms of information than any CW...(shhh..I didn't say that) ;-)  \n",
      "Hope it all goes well!  \n",
      "My nephew (FS) at times goes through these fazes. After he has been sick or his sister and they take medicine for a day or two. He will then continue to ask for it even up to a week or two later. 'Oh I'm sick I need medicine.' It's blueberry flavored so it prob. tastes pretty good. I simply just laugh and say you're silly you aren't sick, medicine isn't candy and we can only take it when we really need it! Or I say if you are really sick we need to go lay in our room and go to bed. He just laughs and walks away.  \n",
      "I don't know about the fever, but my niece snored like a trucker as well and never seemed to be able to breath out her nose so at 5 years they took out her tonsils and adenoids. She is so much better, but when she is very tired or isn't feeling well she still snores... Hope you guys get it figured out!  \n",
      "It sounds like you're living my life :-) We have a three y.o. boy about to be 4 this week. Has been doing great at using the potty for about 6 months, except he will have accidents on visit day, ugggh poor guy. He in the last few weeks has finally somewhat started telling us he has to go potty, but at times still refuses to tell us and won't take himself. So if we are not good about reminding him then we get an accident. So I'm not sure what to do about that. As for the 8 y.o. and tall tales, we have a 6 year old girl and it's the same thing. I can always tell because she starts stuttering really bad. Depending on the story I listen or sometimes I'll stop her and say did that really happen, I figure at some point she'll start to grow out of it, it's nothing harmful or anything so I'm not too worried. Chores, I will have them put away their toys, towel etc. I also have them put away the silverware (I pull out sharp knives first) sometimes I will clean dishes and they put in dish washer or I'll have them help me make beds or put laundry in washer/dryer. Good luck!  \n",
      "So at 6 month court date, over 2 months ago, bio parents asked for one additional weekly visit (currently have 1 a week supervised). They did it for one week and then said they couldn't anymore. They were selling their car because they can't afford it, using the money to get a place with their kids blah blah blah..So visits are out our home and bios have been walking up each week. What's interesting is I come home around same time and never see them walking and bus stop is about 1/2 mile and magically they are here minutes later... so someone I know calls me this evening that the car is parked up the street at the grocery center a good .25 mile from my house.It just makes me sick that they had this whole excuse why they can't see their kids and poor them poor them, when really they can see their kids they still have the freaking car!!! Why even lie about it, just so you don't have to see them more? You asked for the extra day! I don't get why they keep dragging us all through this? It's sickening. I don't know if anything will come of it but I have the email where he gives his sob story and the CW said she received one as well, so I took photos with a newspaper today and the car and we will see if we can do anything with that...9 months later and clearly they haven't changed. They're LIARS and they are okay with putting their children through it! SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICKKKKK!  \n",
      "BoysParentWow! It sounds like they just can't admit that they really don't want to see their kids. It makes me question whether or not they even want to care for them. I also can't stand being lied to. I've caught our current biomom in numerous lies already. She must have taught her 4 yr old well because we are currently dealing with HIS lying issues as well. I have yet to meet a birthparent who I haven't caught in one lie or another. It's important to remember that lying is all many of these people know. They had to lie to get through life and survive. That doesn't make it right, but it is clear it is all they have been taught. All we can do is show these kids another way of life that doesn't consist of lying, cheating or stealing. I totally feel your frustration. I wish I could say it's all they have been taught, but the bio mom is my sister and we were definitely NOT taught to lie. It's just so sad that they are willing to give up time with their children, who are growing so fast, and I would love to care for them, without them in the picture, but they are making us question how long we can continue. I just don't get why they are doing and acting this way!? So we feel sorry for them is all I can assume and so that they can give everyone their sob story and people will give them handouts etc. The worst part was seeing the car and seeing the necklace I had helped make with my nephew a few weeks prior and biodad took it at his last visit. The necklace was hanging in the rear view mirror, and the car seats are in the back, like he still cares for them! I wanted to reach through that window and grab that necklace because he DOES NOT deserve it. And then his daughter asked him to come to open house, which is in three weeks and he said he's love to but he already thinks he has something going on that night! LOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSER!  \n",
      "So we have a three, soon to be four year old! He is a great kid, done great getting potty trained, has his moments, strong willed, but otherwise great. For the past four plus months I think he is becoming more aware of the situation, I think he didn't really get it at first and him coming to live with us wasn't a super big adjustment because we are in fact aunt and uncle and had him every weekend, plus for weeks at a time here and there. Now we are starting to see him really act out on visit days and I think it's because he is starting to connect the dots (as much as a three year old can), but he is wetting his pants multiple times on the visit day (only once per week for an hour and a half), he bit me last week while bio parents were there (acted like he was hugging me and then bit my stomach) never done that before, he's getting really angry and loud and yelling! He asked just a few weeks ago after his parents left, 'why do mom and dad leave?' and we said because they have to go to their home, 'and he said but this is home' we told him this was his home, but mom and dad have their own home for now. Then on top of all this he is really testing calling us mom and dad, he typically does it and then just smiles at us, and I say who are we with a big smile and he just laughs and says our names. I have no issue with it, but I know bio parents would and i don't want to confuse him so we try to refrain and just keep it to Auntie...and Uncle... I know this is normal for kids in this situation, but I feel so bad for him. I try to tell the CW because it doesn't seem fair the kids keep having to go through this while parents just keep doing nothing... It's almost like cut off visits or do them once a month until Bios can get it together more. It's been over 9 months!!! Also we've tried to get him some therapy but the CW just keeps telling us she is looking into it and we never hear back. Any suggestions on how we can help ease what we are assuming is visit anxiety?  \n",
      "So frustrating, how hard is it for the CW to do their jobs? We went to court over 2 months ago, kids are still with us, CW needs to send it the paperwork to have the day care payments extended...simple as that. 2 months later and it's still not done!!! Multiple phone calls and e-mails later, being told it's done over and over again and it's still not! Then on top of it I call and the CW's VM says she will be out for over a month and a half, nothing more! So now I've had to figure out who to even call at this point. Grrrrrrr...I don't get what's so hard about just turning in the sheet, this should be a routine practice I would think?! Grrrrrrr....thanks for listening :-)  \n",
      "Busymex4Not sure if its the right thing, but I know that I would want to just go down there in person! I just had a CW who, IMO, did not do her job! UGH I feel ya! I was just telling my spouse the same thing! 'I am going to go down there and get this done myself!' hehe  \n",
      "OhioFosterMomMany FMs do the CWs jobs at times. Call the director of the agency and/or email. How can you send kiddo to daycare if the funding's not there? The funding has been there all along, we just hit the 6 month review mark and apprently a new agreement had to be sent to the agency that pays saying the kids are still in our care... so that's the crazy part...it's not like it never started, but you would think the CW would have done this well before the 6 month review to make sure there was no interruption, but didn't and now it's over 2 months past our court date and still nothing! I called the new CW, but I think I will start to need to call higher up if I don't hear anything shortly, this is just ridiculous!  \n",
      "So we have a three, soon to be four year old! He is a great kid, done great getting potty trained, has his moments, strong willed, but otherwise great. For the past four plus months I think he is becoming more aware of the situation, I think he didn't really get it at first and him coming to live with us wasn't a super big adjustment because we are in fact aunt and uncle and had him every weekend, plus for weeks at a time here and there. Now we are starting to see him really act out on visit days and I think it's because he is starting to connect the dots (as much as a three year old can), but he is wetting his pants multiple times on the visit day (only once per week for an hour and a half), he bit me last week while bio parents were there (acted like he was hugging me and then bit my stomach) never done that before, he's getting really angry and loud and yelling! He asked just a few weeks ago after his parents left, 'why do mom and dad leave?' and we said because they have to go to their home, 'and he said but this is home' we told him this was his home, but mom and dad have their own home for now. Then on top of all this he is really testing calling us mom and dad, he typically does it and then just smiles at us, and I say who are we with a big smile and he just laughs and says our names. I have no issue with it, but I know bio parents would and i don't want to confuse him so we try to refrain and just keep it to Auntie...and Uncle... I know this is normal for kids in this situation, but I feel so bad for him. I try to tell the CW because it doesn't seem fair the kids keep having to go through this while parents just keep doing nothing... It's almost like cut off visits or do them once a month until Bios can get it together more. It's been over 9 months!!!  \n",
      "Never been asked what we spend the money on, but have been told by bios that we basically have a great deal and get soooo much money to take of their kids, my niece and nephew, and that basically we should be thankful! Ha!!!! That monthly check doesn't cover half of it...time, gas, higher water, electricity, the new couch we had to get because nephew puked all over it and the smell would NOT go away, wear and tear of two kids in the home....not to mention just clothes, sports, normal kid activities etc. So yes we are VERYYYY lucky we get ALL that money. I guess when you're living in a shelter off the government we do look pretty darn lucky. Bio parents can be a joke, it's all about the money, they forget all the other parts that come along with it.  \n",
      "We have a 6 year old girl, she can bathe herself, but I wash her hair (boy with short hair I assume could wash his own), bed between 7:30-8, wakes up between 7:30-8 on non school days. Has to be reminded on wiping after going potty, often done quick so she doesn't miss anything. I can for the most part leave her to take a shower etc. turn on a show she is good to go. Good luck!  \n",
      "Day care is very expensive, but we use it for my nephew who is 3. Thank goodness the county pays up to a certain amount, which covers most home day care providers. In our county there is a wait list for low income, but for foster parents there is no wait list, they take priority for funds, or they have seperate funds set aside, i'm not sure. I currently am trying to find day care closer to our home, when we first set it up we were in a bit of a rush and didn't do a whole lot of trying to find the 'perfect' place. Now we are looking for a more preschool type setting and I am shocked at some of these places, were in a wonderful area, and none of the places are right? I am not sure how you leave your kids all day? Now we are trying to also find summer care for our 6 year old to which adds in a whole new dimension...I guess my point is, is I have to do day care, but now that I am starting to look I am shocked with what you get for what you have to pay. i am now focusing a bit more on the upscale ones, even if we have to pay a portion out of pocket. I hate leaving my little ones all day, so if I have to I want to leave them at a GREAT place. Sorry for the ramble :-) We are in CA by the way!  \n",
      "Does anyone else just feel completely consumed with this? I feel like I am going crazy, and I'm not that kind of person, but not knowing whats happening, not having control, the waiting....It is truly driving me bonkers! All I can think about is, what if this, what if that, what will happen, it's starting to consume me I feel like! We are almost 9 months in...I flip flop everyday with what I want, will I keep the kids, will I now, can I find them a new home...what will the future be like, will they be okay if we have kids, are they going to be like their parents? On top of that the closer we get the more it doesn't look like they will go back, of course I can't know for sure, but then I am concerned will my sig. other be okay with this, long term will he...he says he will, but it's not convincing enough...and most importantly will the kids ever feel like 'our' kids? I'm afraid I will have my own and I won't feel the same way about my niece and nephew or that they will blame us, or never fully accept us as mom and dad. Please tell me I'm not alone with this. How do you all turn it off for a minute?  \n",
      "Well I am not happy to hear you all feel the same way, but I am happy to hear that I am not alone, I was thinking I was crazy and as many of you point out most people who don't do this don't get it... I am kinship and I didn't agree to it in the same way a lot of you may have decided to do it, but it is what it is at this point and I love the kids...I guess this is just a test on my patience on so many levels...I think I need to try and just step back and wait and see what will happen, something I am not very good at, but maybe it's time to learn I can't always have control...as I was saying to someone last night, I just want to get in there and do the CW's job most of the time, I'll finalize this, make the decisions, c'mon lets just wrap it up. If only it were that easy, right!? Thanks for all of you who responded, I hope that your situations work out sooner than later for you...In the mean time, something to distract me...Running, home imporvements...where to begin!? :-)  \n",
      "We used a toddler bed, but it was in our old \"guest room\" and we also had a full bed in there. CPS had no issue with the toddler bed. Although within a week of living with us our 3 year old took claim to the 'big bed.' We got rid of our toddler bed.  \n",
      "Poor thing must be so scared. Now that it is prob. morning where you are maybe you can find out what are some things she likes or makes her feel at home. I know with our 6 y.o. girl, a nice stuffy, blanket and her favorite movie/book she is good to go. Maybe try that? Good luck and all my best!  \n",
      "I do kinship in CA and CPS is involved and you can receive the same monthly stipen up to the amount that foster parents receive. Now I heard the amount is based on the bio parents income when the children come into care...not sure if this is correct information or not. We also receive money to pay for day care, heard this depends on the county and MediCal. Good luck to your friend, it's a tough place to be in.  \n",
      "So last night we had our weekly visit. Both parents showed up.... on most average visits, biomom (my half sis) seems out of it (possible drugs she takes for 'mental illness'), other times she seems very with it, it really just changes from week to week. This week was different...she seemed almost like we were wasting her time, like she didn't want to be there....both my spouse, I and even the children sensed it. A few weeks ago she had a visit by herself, she had said to me that kids seemed very happy and she never could give them what we have. I just feel like I am getting this sense that she doesn't want to go back to parenting, she wants to visit now and then nothing more, but I get the sense as well that biodad is somewhat forcing her to want to do it because he knows he couldn't do it alone, his words not mine, although I completely agree! My question is, being that it is my sister, would I be totally out of line to write and e-mail and just ask what the heck she is wanting from all of this? Everyone else aside, what does she want and think is best? Is it simply she wants a few visits here and there? I just don't want the kids to go back to someone who is doing it because they feel forced, and from what I saw last night, there was no since of joy to see her children that she has not saw or even spoke to for a week. No comforting after she found out they had been sick with the flu all week...it's just odd to me?  \n",
      "How far in advance were you told before the 12 month review what was expected to happen then? We were told the CW would submit a review to the court for our August court date, and I am wondering when the FP's are told that they will begin to TPR, RU or extend the additional 6 months...  \n",
      "@luvbeingamom - I feel like we are the last to know everything as well... and I want an idea oh so bad! They still only have one, one and half hour supervised visit a week. Parents still have not even got housing or stable jobs for themselves, BioDad recently got rid of car since he can't afford it. Mom suffers mental illness, supposedly. It's a kinship case, our boy was 3.5 when the case began, girl was 6. I mean to me I don't know why they would be granted the 6 month extension and it doesn't look like they'll go back...but that's me of course. What's been your take?  \n",
      "luvbeingamomLifechanges: I've never fostered a child over the age of 3, but like I said in the above paragraph here they hand out extentions almost automatically to 12 months when they are supposed to start TPR proceedings at 6 months if the plan is not completed when the kids are babies. I'm also kinship & I have found that CPS kinda puts us on the \"back burner\". My neice relinquished over a year ago & we have still not been able to adopt. I'm getting really frustrated!:hissy: This is very much a fear of mine. I am in spot that I want to get married and start having children of my own, but I refuse to do that with all the chaos we currently are experiencing. I am willing to take on my niece and nephew, assuming we can adopt them and begin a family of our own without BioMom (half sis) and Biodad being involved or having weekly visitations, but if it doesn't look like they are moving to TPR at 12 months I think we may have to call it quits. I don't understand how they can just make us sit around and wait. As you said it's been nearly a year, almost 2 since they have not lived with BioDad how do they expect these kids will just be fine going back, at some point. It's sad, they need stability and to know what to expect and at this point we still don't and it's sad. And the waiting is almost forcing us to quit.  \n",
      "luvbeingamomIn my experience, with both our cases where RU failed, the parents did well until about 5 months in. They didn't quite get it together so extention. I thought, ok I understand. But, it sounds like almost everyone here gets that extention talking to other foster adopt parents. Rediculous! Children need permanancy! That has been our experience, up until about the 5 month mark it seemed like ok they may get it together, so they got the extension. Now at the almost 9 month mark it seems like we've completely gone backwards. They're still coming to the once a week visitation, but nothing more...kind of crazy. I just surely hope they don't get an additional 6 months, but our luck they will pull something out of their 'magic' hats right as we are about to go to court that will change everything. And yes I agree children do need permanency, but at this point I feel so sad I can't tell my niece one way or another.  \n",
      "We got our guy for Xmas the DS, he was 3.5 at the time. He really likes it, but some of the games are a bit tough, a lot of reading, so we find we often have to sit and play with him. Some of the race car type games are better for him. Also, he LOVES the photo taking app that comes with it. He will do that for hours. I would think in the next 6 moths and as he starts to read it will be perfect for him. We tried the leap pad, but it was painfully slow in loading and trying to trace letters and such you had to do it perfect, me and my spouse often couldn't even do it well enough. Plus the games and books and such are VERRRY expensive! So all in all I would suggest the DS, it may take a bit of time, but they'll catch on. Plus we could prob do a better job of finding more age appropriate games. Him and his 6 y.o sister often share. Edit: We have the ipad as well which he REALLY enjoys, but that is not something I let him do on his own. His tapping and lightly touching skills are minimal. haha! It's too expensive to just hand it too him and say have fun...maybe an Ipod touch though??  \n",
      "I completely understand your frustrations. We are doing kinship care and it seems like the BM (my half-sis) and BF keep doing the most ridiculous things and none of it is in the best interest of their children. 1. BF has an iphone, mom recently got a phone as well and proceeded to setup her vm during the visit for 15 min. 2. Both have no problem smoking and chewing 3. Come to every visit with a Peet's coffee or coke ...the list goes on and on.... And then recently they requested one extra visit a week for 3 hours (the currently only have a one and a half hour visit once per week) that lasted 1 week and then they stopped because they no longer could afford the insurance for the car or the car payment so they couldn't get to the visit...(heard of a bus, bike or walking?) Yet they can afford phones and other stuff....Funny how their kids NEVVVVVVVVVVVER come first, but it's always been that way. It's been hard, but I am starting to realize you really have to ignore it and look past it and know that you're doing this for the kids not their parents...clearly they still aren't making good choices and that just makes their case look worse.  \n",
      "Loving4wardWhile I agree that this is what they are taught... but isn't there a point where we as a society have to say ENOUGH...If you are living in a homeless shelter and tanning and getting your nails done and have a brand new iphone...maybe she needs some tough love and put out on the streets. Maybe then her priorities would change. She has to move out in 6 months and is supposed to be saving...if she isn't doing that shouldn't the program she is in step in and do something. I really think we are failing here in our attempts to \"help\" people. I'd have to disagree that this is what they have been taught. Yes, I am sure a majority of them have been, but my sis is in the same screwed up place a lot of your bio parents are, and we came from a very 'normal' family. My dad (her step dad) and mom raised her from a very young age, me and two other siblings, we we're never taught any of what she is doing to her children. We were taught just the opposite in fact, hence me trying to do the right thing by her children. So it's not always taught...sometimes I think it's chosen, and the system doesn't always seem to help breaking the 'laziness,' IMHO.  \n",
      "As I sit here this evening, kids just went down, 3 year old has flu, 6 year old just got over it...our first barfing experience... Then I get a phone call from bio mom (my half sister) never calls, has one visit a week for an hour and a half and hasn't tried to do much to get her kids back or act like she cares...any how she leaves a message... \"I have an apartment now the shelter set me up with, please feel free to bring the kids by on the weekend (40 min. drive for us each way) I know you prob. won't though (poor her). Also, they have room in the family mental shelter opening up in a couple months, I think I'm top of the list so we (her and bio dad) will be getting kids back soon...\" How after 10 months of having your children do you just leave that message and think that is okay, you've done nothing to get your kids back, you don't even act like you care about them...how do you think it's okay to just leave them, in a great home, in a great area, just thriving and think that it's okay to move them to a F***ing mental shelter?? How will they feel? How will they respond to that? How comfortable will they be when they have things like the flu?? But what it really makes me realize is just how pissed I am, I won't/can't just be okay with that. Of course she can say what she wants it's up to the courts, but still the thought drives me crazy...I wanted my 'old life' back, but now I realize it's my 'old life' my life now is taking care of two kids, even when they're sick and barfing...I don't think I can be okay with this.:hissy:  \n",
      "We just had our first barfing experience as well! Holy cow... hehe, but we made it through, barely! :-)Although, we did go to the doctor today because niece (FD) was still having tummy cramps after 4 days pretty badly (or so she said), doc's advice, no juice (unless child is not drinking any other liquid than reaaaaaallly water down) and no straight milk, try to keep sugars to a min. as well. Eat rice, yogurt, apple sauce etc. lots of rest and lots of water. She for the most part seemed pretty well today, but with the tummy pain we figured a quick trip to the doctor was better safe than sorry.Good Luck!!! Now we just hope the other one doesn't get it...fingers crossed!  \n",
      "I am very sorry you are having to go through that, I am dreading that day if it does come, we are 9 months in, with no bio kids of our own yet and I can't imagine the possibility of going from 2 to none. I would definitely suggest taking some time to spend with your hubby and just enjoying the 2 of you and your time together until you get your new placement!Take care...  \n",
      "I'm in CA and doing kinship care. We do get the monthly FP stipened amount, as well as day care paid for and Medical. We had to do back ground, home study and finder printing, but not the classes and such.Good luck with your case...one thing I wished someone had told me in the beginning is make it very clear what you want because I do think kinship providers are expected to do more than the average FP. Also, don't do visits in your home. I of course said 'no no I am civil with my sister and her sig. other it will be fine', 9 months later it's ALLL changed just like everyone said it would and I can't stand them in my home, but we are civil and it works best for the kids right now. In other words be strong in what you want from the beginning and take others advice that have done this they are often right with their advice.  \n",
      "Yes to the above PP suggestion or is there any way you can call CPS and tell them the amount of days they are being left with you. My sister was leaving her kids for weeks at a time, then at one point it had turned into a month and who knew when she was going to pick them up. CPS was called multiple times and I realized you literally have to raise hell. One day they received and annonymous phone call (it really was) and they showed up at my door, I told them the kids were abandoned with me and they began their investigation, 9 months later and I am thankful to whoever made that call...I know you situation isn't the same, but maybe it would work??? I wish you luck with all of this, these children's story breaks my heart and I can't imagine how you felt dropping him off this evening, that's one of my biggest fear with our kiddos if they do end up going home, it's gonna break my heart ...  \n",
      "Let me start off by saying, I have not yet had children of my own, so this might be normal, but I just don't think it is... We have my 6 year old niece, she is extremely bright (I mean extremely bright!), but has absolutely no common sense. We have had her now for about 9 months. My concern is, is she has some quirks that I am not sure if it's normal for a child her age, learned from her parents or maybe something we should address... I would love to know from people who have a child this age is this normal, am I just overthinking it? - She often just stops and stares, no matter what she is doing. Taking the cereal bowl to the sink if she sees anything she is immediately distracted, for up to 10 min at times if we don't keep her on track. Going peepee we will find her in there 15 min later just staring at the door, walking to class and the people driving next to us, if she seems something in the car she will literally walk over and just stare in the window (it's a little creepy) - Doing simple tasks that we remind her over and over each day (they don't change) get done if we are reminding her from task to task. We've tried just letting her figure it out, but she ALWAYS get distracted. - Completing things rarely happens, she loves to read, avid reader, but will start a book get part way through gets distracted and starts another, I am constantly putting half read books back in her room. Or doing a craft, it has to be either super quick otherwise they never get done. - She is great at school and will sit and do her homework. Loves to read, but can't finish books or sit in one spot. Video games will keep her attention - Doing new things or hard things is a struggle, anything challenging she does not want to do. Again, the stopping and staring is the biggest concern, she seems great otherwise and seems like she is trying VERY hard, but still just can't get the simplest tasks. Is this normal around this age?  \n",
      "I kind of was wondering if it was like an ADD, but as a PP said I don't love the idea of possible meds, but I definitely think we should prob. get her evaluated, I know her BF has severe ADHD and her birthmom I beleive does as well, although has not been diagnosed. @ Biblemom- It's a blank stare at times, but other times she simply gets distracted by anything and everything and I'm not sure if she is staring at it or reading it or what. I have asked and she always says she doesn't really know. I try to say are you thinking of something, but again she doesn't know... This happens all day every day (at home at least, I will be writing her teacher as well), if she is interested in it though it's got her full attention, like video games, otherwise it's us constantly reminding (which I feel like us always on her is starting to get to her, and I don't like that). I don't know about PTSD, very well could be, she has been through A LOT this year, but the fact it's very similar to her parents makes me think maybe inherited? Might I ask how you all got started on getting her tested? Did you ask CW or simply find a Doctor on your own? She is a wonderful kid otherwise, I just worry she is headed down her mom's path, because she is soooo simlar (her BM is my half sister). I just don't want her to think she is anymore different then she already is, and I worry getting her tested and such may make her feel that way. Living with her aunt and uncle, having mom and dad visit, and 'weird' CW visits has already been an adjustment enough....  \n",
      "Yes I don't think it is absense seizures, because we talk to her and she hears us, it's simply getting her to change her focus. She is such a wonderful kid, well behaved, just can't get the focusing down. I feel bad for her I know she tries so hard and she is trying to please us, but it's hard for her. I feel like we are always nagging her because my spouse and I are so the opposite, get in, get it done and move on, so we are trying very hard to see it from her view, because after 9 months it's clear she is not just being lazy or defiant.  \n",
      "I absolutely understand where you are coming from, I am fostering my niece and nephew and the family dynamic is so challenging. BM (my sister) and BF will not admit to the fact they played any part in their children being placed with us they simply want to blame everyone else. But we are now 9 months in with cps involvement and over a year and a half of just trying to help them get it together and still nothing, it actually almost seems like it got worse. I wish I could offer you words of encouragement, but all I can say is it's really tough and there is going to be good and bad days and I am learning that you have to seperate your self as much as you can from the family/drama and that helps. Good luck!  \n",
      "I received a call today from a CW who said she was in the specialized unit in our county, we are in CA. She said our CW referred our case to her and she wanted to come over to chat. Our 12 month review is in Aug, but the report will be submitted sometime in July. From the sounds of it this 'new' person wants to feel us out if we will keep the kids permanently or not. Said that from the looks of BM mental history she will more than likely not getting the kids back and that BF really isn't doing what they had hoped and that they really like children to remain with family memebers (i am bio aunt). So is this the next step showing that they are considering TPR or am I totally reading into this? We have been asked this multiple times over the course of things, but this person sounded much more like 'the person' who will be looking more at permanency options. Any BTDT?  \n",
      "Nevada JenHa! I suspect its worse than the TPR talk. I bet its the permanent gaurdianship talk. Also know as the \"we would really like you to this for free for an indefinate amount of time with no healthcare or services for the kids so we can close our case\" talk. Hmmmm I did not even consider that, so just to clarify, if you know, permanent guardianship means parents can go to court at any time and get children back if judge approves? Also, there is not help in terms of funding. I'm 25, bought my first house a couple of year ago, go to school full time and work full time, that's not even an option for us, we can't raise 2 kids, with out help paying for day care etc. That's crazy talk! But thanks for the heads up! Although, I will say she did mention adoption and did make sure to say in our county CPS requires a closed adoption...  \n",
      "Nevada JenYou've basically got Permanent Gaurdianship figured out. I always chuckle when you describe how not ready you are for this. If you want to do it, you can certainly do it. You are old enough and have more than many who have gone on to be very successful parents. Maybe it's not that I don't think I can't do it, I still question if I want to do it. I love them I truly do, but I still have that selfish piece of me that wants this to all go away (kids being in a wonderful home and safe of course) and me to go back to where I was before all this began. It's a huge freaking decision that I am not sure I am prepared to make it, that's all...pretty much it comes down to I wasn't ready to make the 'kid' commitment yet, I can do it and if I decide to I will continue to do the best job I know how...just a lot of mixed emotions I guess. Can't get the best of both worlds unfortunately...  \n",
      "luvbeingamom - thanks for the information, very helpful. I did find the person is from the 'family finding/engagement unit' any familiarity with this?  \n",
      "I have my niece and nephew, my sister and I aren't super close but at this point I wouldn't even consider her a sister. It makes me so sick how she has treated her children and how rude and inconsiderate her and her sig other (bf) have been to us. They have supervised visits by us once a week and we are civil for the kids sake but nothing more. Until she can begin acting like a mother it's my job to protect them, no matter what she may or may not want. It makes me very sad to hear of family members taking kids just to give them back to unfit parents or not following supervision rules. CPS doesn't just get involved to make things difficult, they do it because there is a problem. I feel it's my job to be the children's advocate and protect them, if bm and bf want to get it together, by all means...but I refuse to be a family member who lets children go back to a bad situation, family or not! Just my two cents :-)  \n",
      "That is odd he did not just throw it out, but I know my nephew (FS) who is 3 is at an age where he is soooo opinionated over everything!!!! I would just leave it out as others have said, in a spot where he can reach it, and let him decide...And too maybe because it washed it doesn't smell like it used to??? Just a thought. Good luck!  \n",
      "Yes here in Cali my understanding is CPS stays involved for an additional 6-12 months after reunification is complete. I specifically asked my CW this because in our case if my niece and nephew go back to their biological parents there is a chance they may go back with BF only since BM is mentally unstable, but I believe they will try to live together and so I wanted to make sure they'd be aware if this was the case. So hopefully it is the same in your case as well and this will be brought to their attention. I mean technically BM could say she doesn't live there, but if they speak with the children maybe they will say otherwise. I really hope for the children's sake they stay safe...I'm am very sorry as well you have to worry for them. I can only imagine...  \n",
      "I am in Cali as well, but it's been quite a few months since our placement. If I remember correctly its the court hearing to let the parents know why their children were taken in to custody? Not certain though. Before the children were placed there was papers filed with the court to have the kids removed and the parents were served Then we had a sit down meeting to develop a plan Then we went to court to have the judge officially rule that the children stay in our care. As well the parents were given their official case to work. Then 6 month hearing to review and now we are wating are 12 month hearing So I am not sure exactly where you fall in the process, but this is how ours went. I hope this helps! I know i hear 5.1 hearing, but i forget exactly which hearing that was.  \n",
      "Everyday! And you are so right, actions speak lounder than words...It is just baffling to me how parents could just not give a rip about their kids...I'm still trying to figure this one out myself??? And to say you will do anything...do they think sitting doing nothing, but at least they're thinking about the situation (maybe), is doing everything??? It just confuses me...ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING, ANYTHING!! I want to scream that every visitation, but I know my words mean nothing...They just don't get it... Your situation sounds a lot like mine, except I get the pleasure of being related to the biomom...Yipeeee! I actually was the aunt that stepped up to try and do the right thing, but believe me it's so **** hard... I hope that little D's mother and this family do actually try to do the right thing to get him back, we're 9 months in about and still got nothing.... Good luck!  \n",
      "[QUOTE=Kat-L]I had a foster child who's parents never showed up for visits. I'd take her and after 15 minutes, I'd bring her back home. One day Mom didn't come because she missed the bus. I said to my oldest, \"I wouldn't miss a visit with you for any reason. If I had to get up at 4am and walk to child welfare, I would be there.\". She was quiet for a couple minutes and then said \"I love you.\". [QUOTE] My niece and nephew (FK's), BF just requested more visits, got granted them, did one and has now decided to sell his car so can't do it anymore. I said the same thing? I would do anything, walk, bike, bus, train, hitchhike anything just to get that little time if it were my kids...but nope he's just going to play poor poor me and cancel them... I just don't get it.  \n",
      "So yesterday we were out taking a walk (sig other, niece, nephew and myself). My niece (FD, 6) was sitting on the curb waiting for us to catch up and she handed me a flower and said 'So will you adopt me now?' I was very taken aback and had no idea what to say...she ran off and it didn't come up again. Now this isn't something we've discussed nor is it something we've really said between my sig other and myself. We talk about them staying or they may have to go back etc etc, but I was a little unclear where this specific thought came from, where she heard about adoption and why she asked out of the blue? I asked her about it later that night, real casually said 'Hey so if you ever have questions, or are confused about this situation or anything else you can always ask me or your uncle. I know you asked if I would adopt you earlier...now what does that mean to you?' She responded that it meant she didn't have a home and we gave her one (which wasn't really the case to begin with). 'I simply said no matter what happens she will always have a room here and this will always be home for her to! (being that we are family I can offer her this), but I also said right now I don't know if she will be staying forever or if she will be moving back with mom and dad because that isn't for me to decide, but as soon as I know more I will let her know.' She just said okay and that was the end. Should I have said more, less? Do you think she wants us to adopt her or is she scared we are trying to keep her from her parents? I feel so sad for her, no 6 year old should have to think about this stuff. I just want to put her at ease and do what's best, but I'm not really sure what that is...  \n",
      "We still have this issue with our little guy and he will be 4 in the next few months. He will not go unless you tell him every hour or two and telling most of the time means physically taking his hand and walking him after asking 'Do you have to potty?' 'No.' But our 6 y.o. FD can be the same way at times as well, you have to always be reminding her to go as well, otherwise she just hold and holds and holds it (no accidents though, she will go if it's bad enough). So i don't know if it's the kids just don't like to be interuppted or if it is something more, but our little guy never takes the initiative, he's been potty trained about 4 months as well. Not too many accidents, maybe 1 every 2 weeks or more....but we definitely have to be on our toes to make sure we remind him.  \n",
      "So things started to look up, or so we thought, more visits, parents seemed to be getting things on track...well that was short lived... Additional visits that were just added (only one has happened) cancelled...the initial one visit a week for a whole whopping hour and a half, up in the air.... and why because the parents have this 'new' plan! It's crazy to me! You've had a million plans and not one has worked out and now you've changed everything, not for the better, but instead you are sacrificing the only time with your kids so you can work on this new plan...which all the new plan is, is telling everyone your sob story and asking is there any way you can help (aka give me money). You've had over a year people, your case plan isn't that hard. Go to your couple of classes, get drug tested, get a decent place for the kids to live and have a way to pay for it.... So aggravating and so sad for their poor children. I don't have children of my own yet, but I don't know how you can't want to do everything in your power to do the right thing and see them every minute possible, but then again I guess I have to remember I would have never let this happen to my children in the first place. It just sucks to know that one day they will find out who their parents really are, and I hope by that time they aren't completely dissapointed, but the fact of the matter is they will prob. be. So i guess all in all I was thinking, 'Wow maybe they will be going back,' but I was quickly reminded that it can all change in a heart beat, like it just did...So now, we wait (until August)...  \n",
      "I agree with you both, it makes absolutely no since. They're kids and their pains in the butt, but that doesn't stop me from not wanting to protect and do everything in my power to give them the best I am capable of giving them, and they aren't even my own biological children... We have days that suck, bad moods, attitudes and tantrums, but I look forward to the moments like the other night when my nephew (3) turned to me and said 'hey I forgot to kiss you today, that's silly!' Grabbed me and gave me a big 'ol hug and kiss. Or the joy of teaching my niece to ride her bike, or play their first video game, or my nephew saying sentences and learning all this new stuff. How can you not want every moment of that? Fine you've had it rough, but you just lost your **** kids, suck it up and get them back, no one is stopping you, but you....How can they not see that...they're the only problem...I truly to some degree wish I understood, because I try so hard and I just can't...I really truly just can't...as the PP said I would do just about anything in the world as well because as a parent in my opinion that's what you do when you have kids and that's what you want to do...  \n",
      "FostertoforeverIn my dysfunctional extended family, they learn from their parents. They think it's normal to leave your kids to go par-Tay & not keep up with them. My cousins kid was 10 years old & someone would ask (@4pm): \"Where's Trey?\" \"idk, he left this morning...\" Trey is now homeless. He was never mothered & neither was his mother...Sad! I wish in our situation it was a simple explanation like this, but it's not...we are fostering my niece and nephew and their mother is my biological sister. We have a wonderful family, wonderul parents, grew up in a great area, etc etc, mind you we aren't perfect, but definitely were not shown to abandon our children... That is very sad for that little boy, Trey...I hope he realizes there is more out there and you can create your own destiny....  \n",
      "irq11 - It definitely sounds like we are in the same boat and it sounds like we agree on many levels about the situations we were placed in. This new 'plan' is their own plan...funny enough they requested the extra visitation day at our last court date, they were granted it, we did one and now they are cancelling it. And I agree I can't imagine this looks good on them what so ever...that they're willing to sacrafice the little time with their children to once again come up with a new plan, which sounds ridiculous and completely unattainable for them, given what they've showed us in the last 9 months. But who knows maybe they're gonna shock us all or a miracle will happen... :-) And I 100% degree on the time frame situation, why keep pushing and pushing the time frame longer when NOTHING is being done? I get people get in a rough place and maybe they're trying everything possible, but need a bit more time, not in my case, they don't care...my feeling is they like to visit and go live the 'single' life once again... Good luck with you case...  \n",
      "So visitation falls on BM birthday. Because BM is my sister I have always been nice and gone out of my way and celebrated her birthday. Now her children are living with me, and this past birthday of mine she couldn't even bother to wish me a happy birthday when mine rolled around so I feel like shouldn't I even bother to do something? Kids don't know it's her birthday and BF comes to visits as well, he is still her signifigant other. I feel if he wanted to have the kids do a little something for her that would be more than fine with me, as a matter of fact I would think it would be great because that's what families do and if they plan on getting their's back that's a step in the right direction, but I don't feel I should really go out of my way to remind him or celebrate it...if the kids asked of course I would let them do something, but they don't even know... Pretty petty I know, but somewhere deep down I do feel kind of bad, but i don't think I should... So what would you do?  \n",
      "So her sig. other (BF) was a no show, typical, she had to walk to the visitation in the rain after taking the bus, so we picked her up. We didn't do much, but I did have a little dessert I had made a few days prior so we did that with a little candle and the kids enjoyed it, then they got there art supplies out and did crafts together, the kids didn't make her anything, but I think they enjoyed doing it and I think she did as well. I gave her a few photos and drove her back to the bus stop, but of course we walk out and my tire was flat!!!! Grrrrrrr, so I was able to take my spouses car and it all worked out. But isn't that just how it works, if it's not one thing it's 10 others, but I put on a smile and we dealt with it. It all worked out and I'm glad I was the bigger person and just did a little something, especially because as you all say, it's the kids I am teaching... I should add that in driving her back she did ask how the kids were and acknowledged how happy they seem...I can't imagine this was easy to admit, and it wasn't a direct Thank you, but it did feel nice to hear and so I will accept it as that!  \n",
      "We also went from being a single couple to having a 3 & 6 year old, we have done more laundry, dishes and taking out of the garbage in the last 8 months then I think I ever have! And I agree with PP I typically have everything cleaned up before bed and ended up leaving dishes in the sink the other night after a long week of college finals and my niece (fd) came in and said it really looks like the dishes need to get done, the sink is full! Haha I guess at least she apprreciates the picked up home! Much different from what she is used to.  \n",
      "...how much I cared about my niece (FD) and nephew (FS) until they just left on their first unsupervised visit. I mean I knew I loved them and I wanted the best, but watching them go and knowing that for three hours I don't get to know what they're doing, where they are going or if they are safe is like a huge knife to the heart and it's only 3 hours... It makes me really question what will happen if they truly have to go back, I say it will be nice to get back to my life, but I may have to start having kids of my own! I say there are days I want to give up, but it's today that really makes me realize how much we've grown into a family of our own and the thought of them going back to the situation they came from permanently is heart wrenching. Now time to get a fun movie and dinner out for when they get home, so we can just hang when they get back!!!! (...counting the minutes...) Plus, it's too quiet!!  \n",
      "So we are starting unsupervised visits tomorrow. Which sucks! One day a week was already too much and now we are at 2. What I would like to know is do I have any type of right to know where the parents will be taking the children? I mean I raise them full time and I want to know where there substance abusing father and mentally ill mother (who mind you cannot be alone with them) is taking them? But the BF refuses to tell me...I guess it's the little power he thinks he still has, and I know he just is trying to PISS ME OFF and it's working. I care so much for these kids...If something happen or they didn't come home on time I want to know where to start looking. I hate to seem like a downer, but it's the fact of the matter. What's your guys' experience? Mind you these are family members I am dealing with and I am doing this as the right thing for my niece and nephew, but SW is coming to visit tonight and I am tempted to tell her I'm through. Not because of the kids, but the games...I don't deserve this... and at the end of the day I know they're prob. going back to these loosers and moving to shelter for the mentally ill...That's exactly what I want to see...Not! I want to do the right thing, but it's realllllllllllllllllllllly hard knowing the two kids you love are going back to a ****ty situation and that you just get screwed along the way with the little games and then in the end it's our hearts that get broken and the kids that get hurt! It's not fair!  \n",
      "I have heards kids can regress at times and just put them in a pull up and try again in a few days. Or as the PP said any big changes. Our FS (3) has been wetting himself only on days when he has to see mom and dad for the last month. We explain it was an accident, but we still have to use the potty. He has done it a few times to when he hasn't got his way. We put him immediately back in pullups and explain it's okay to be mad but we don't pee our pants, when he's ready to be a big boy he can have udnerwear back. He is in his Mr. Independent stage so he does not like this at all! Also, I have heard bladder infections could be the cause. May want to have a doctor check it out if it's unusual for him to do this and if there hasn't been any major changes in his life that you are aware of. Also, I would check with school to make sure they aren't disciplining him in some new way or something, maybe he is acting out?  \n",
      "Thank you for posting this thread. You all make such valid points. I never wanted to be a foster parents, I am doing it because I love my niece and nephew and want the best for them... We don't know what's going to happen in our case...I want to say if they do decide to TPR I will say yes, but that is something I struggle with every day. What would I do? I have dealt with a lot of difficult things in my life, but deciding the best for two children you love deeply is by far the hardest... I ask myself some of the very questions you all pose... 1. Can I imagine life without them at this point? Yes, but absolutely not. 2. Can I deal with knowing their parents may try and come around even after it's finalize? No 3. Do I love them so deeply and want the best for them? 100000000% 4. Do I wish I had my own life back and I could still guarantee them a GREAT life? Absolutely. 5. Do I want the best of both worlds? Probably. 6. Can I forgive myself if it does get TPR'd, and I say 'no' to adoption, knowing I could do it, but selfishly can't and don't want to...? I really really don't know. 7. Do I wonder if things will get easier if it is finalized and I don't have to deal with all the other drama...Yes. I just don't know what in the world I will decide, all I know is I feel like the thoughts are consuming my life and I want the whole 'process' to end, one way or another.... So with all of my own mixed up feelings I can only imagine what you must be feeling actually going through it. I think it is wonderful you are able to make that choice knowing it is prob. better for the child and yourself, no matter how hard it is. I hope through this I can find that strength and ability to answer my own looming questions. Take care...  \n",
      "So we just found out that my niece (FD) and nephew (FS) have another sibling. Apparently their BM had a child about 8-10 years ago and gave it up for adoption (she had dissapeared for a few years, that's why no one had any idea). A few family members had suspected due to over hearing information, but no one ever knew for sure. Well she confirmed it. My question is, is there any way to track down information if it was not done formally? I brought it up to our CW and she said they can't use the information because nothing comes up when they search so it doesn't seem like it was done formally. This I would think make a difference in her kids going back to her if she has already given one child up.... Any thoughts?  \n",
      "We had it happen on my nephews (FS) PeePee too. He kept complaining it was bugging him so finally I had his uncle look and never would have thought, but a hair was really wrapped around it...Poor guy!  \n",
      "It's been almost 8 months...I'm not sure if it's me or the kids, but the closer and closer we get to the 12 month mark and the potential for TPR I just think, is this always how it's going to be if we take this on permanently? I feel like the kids to the most degree love us, but I don't feel like they need us or really care about us the way kids typically do about their parents. I don't want to replace their parents but I don't know if I can be okay with just being 'here' either. I also feel like they still lack in so many areas of listening, following rules etc, and I get it comes with age... Today my niece (FD, 6) was so rude in the way she was talking to me, okay well it actually was all weekend (so much like her mother, very very manipulative). Saturday I went and bought her a green shirt for St. Patty's day that she really wanted, I got home and shower her and she threw it on the ground and walked away. I explained it made me sad and she hurt my feelings and she didn't seem to care at all. Then today she was incredibly rude again, and so I once again explained how we can't talk that way and she is really making us sad and had her sit in her room. She came out a few minutes later, saw my Ipad said she wanted to play it and I told her no, she has been very rude and I didn't felt she deserved time on it. She immediately went and made me a card, very nice, but I think it was being done just so I'd let her play, I didn't give in. Then later...I'm making dinner and put dinner down on the table...'ugggh I had corn today,' I picked it up threw the corn away and set it back down. She threw a fit. Got up went to that card she had made me ripped a chunk of it off and said that's what you're gonna get when I'm mad at you. I once again made her sit in her room. I for the third time said she was hurting my feelings and I asked her what was bothering her and why she is acting like this? She had every ridiculous excuse and then did this smirking laugh...once again like she really just did not care. So now that I have rambled, I am scared if this becomes permanent and once again I am back to being scared and wondering if I can handle her and her brother, forever? I love them I truly do, but i see so much of their parents, mother especially in them and that scares me. Her mother is my sister and I know how horrible she could make it at times growing up and still can. I don't know if I can be willing to take the chance of her daughter being just like her and dealing with that once I decide I want kids of my own. I guess all in all after 8 months I thought we would be feeling more like a \"family\" and not more and more like 'what the hell have we got ourselves into?' I feel terrible for feeling this way, we are family, but the fact of the matter is I do feel this way and I just want my life back, but I want the best for them as well....  \n",
      "I appreciate everyone's feedback. I definitely will take this all into consideration and try not to give her the power. I think in some ways I still try to be fun aunt, although we do have a lot of rules. Plus I think sometimes I feel bad that they're in this situation. But I have to stop feeling that way when it comes to rules. And I definitely will stop putting the power in her court by saying she hurt my feelings. I did not even think of it that way. As for the shirt, it did go back. And for dinner, we have no problem with eating. We prob. actually sometimes have issues with overeating. In her case it was prob. more of a punishment to take the corn away, because she does actually eat her fruit and veggies and loves them. Mind you we had another blow up after dinner and dessert went away as well and I politely asked her to sit in her room until she was done. I think she got the point. I also am now a huge fan of Pinterest and saw the idea of a 'Thankful' board as well as a complainer box and kindness jar. 1. Thankful board = a poster board that every time they complain they have to go write something they're thankful for on the poster. 2. Complainer box - Thinking I could turn it into a box that has consequences if we don't follow the rules or act direspctfully, loose a few minutes outside, go to bed 5 minutes early etc., nothing too harsh. 3. Kindness Jar - Has kind things to choose from that a child has to do when they are mean. Hit your brother, go choose a task that you have to complete... I was thinking I may try one or all of these ideas... Any thoughts, reasons I shouldn't? I'm new to this parenting thing and we got dealt a tough situation. I don't want to give up or give in because of this, but need to find the right boundaries to break them or start to of some of these habits. I mean I know exactly where she gets this from and she was never taught different, but clearly the way I am trying to help her isn't working.  \n",
      "I am so sorry you are having to deal with all of this and I know how exhausting it can be. My nephew (FS) who is almost 4 can be a lot of the same ways it sounds like your 2 y.o. is being. He constantly thinks he is in control and when it comes to time outs it turns into a game or him screaming and hitting as well. We have began putting him in his room with the door shut until he calms down, we do not have any toys or anything in there to play with. He gets 3 minutes since he is 3 y.o. He is the sweetest darn boy when he is not trying to get his way and LOVES helping, but when you catch him in a mood or say something he doesn't want to hear it's down hill from there. The high pitch screaming and crying is what really drives us all crazy and then he won't listen at all you open your mouth and he just screams louder. You would think after 7 months and us not giving in it he would stop and figure out another way to deal with it. For instance, yesterday he wanted to go swimming, 'It's summer today I go swimming'. No it's not summer and it's cold and I am sorry we will not be swimming today...boy was that the wrong thing to say to him...so we just ignored him as he blew up...Then after about 5 minutes he was fine again... Kinda crazy!!! Now I don't have any kids of my own yet so i have no clue if this is normal at this age, but I am quickly rethinking children if it is...hehe So I am sorry I don't have much advice, but would love some myself. I do however sympathize with you and wouldn't think you were wrong for putting your own children first if things don't get better for you. Take care!  \n",
      "We have a VERY active 3 y.o. boy...he is constantly busy and is ALWAYS getting hurt as well, will fall on scooter scrape his knees get up and do it all over, when will he learn! We try very hard to make sure he is active when possible, park, bike, scooter, even just running up and down hall, he will even just run circles in the kitchen and back yard for no reason. He has been with us about 7 months and has calmed down a bit, but still goes goes goes. We try also to do quiet time, watch a movie, read a book, do school work and he will sit there for some amount of time, but there has to be no distractions, like his sister. I don't have kids of my own yet, but feel like it could be the way he is. I as well worry about him going to school! But I will say he goes right down to bed at 7:30-8 and will sleep through the night no problem (I am knocking on wood hehe)  \n",
      "What is the likely hood of reunification with a parent that has a mental illness, from those that have BTDT? Part of the reason children were removed was because mom had thoughts of hurting them, plus was not caring for them properly, been in and out of mental hospital multiple times in last year, most recent episode being 3 months into children coming into our care. She shows up at all visits and is working her case plan to some degree, but done nothing other than that, and still does not have a place of her own. I believe she loves the kids, but doesn't seem like she's working real hard toward RU besides the bare minimum. BD seems like he could possibly care for children, but has issues of his own and definitely cannot do it without having BM care for the children the bulk of the time while he is at work...I'm concerned for the outcome if they go back...  \n",
      "Thank you for the responses. In your guys' experience when is the psych evaluation completed? This is the first time i have heard of something like this. We just had our 6 month evaluation and the parents got a 6 month extension and we did not hear of this. In our case we are dealing with a dx of schizoaffective, which in some places I have read can be very serious and some I see it can be controlled with medication if taken correctly...  \n",
      "@luckyduck That's what I am worried about as well. In our case mom has the mental illness and dad has issues of his own. BD prob. looks better to CPS in terms of raising the kids, but his goal is get them back and then leave them with BM all day while he goes to work (maybe?) or do whatever he does when he is done with the kids. That is the scary part because BM (IMHO) has no business at raising these children at this point, but BD cannot do it without her...I guarantee it. BM comes for visits and is literally like comatose and just stares at the children, rarely interacts with them at all and it's so scary to think they could go back to that...  \n",
      "@MrsD - Yes, definitely does not reassure me, but it's something I am preparing myself for...I am sorry you had to go through that yourself... in our care they are family so we will still be in their lives, but I would hate to see them regress going back into that situation and not be able to do a darn thing about it and more than likely this will all continue to happen as it has been for almost 2 years now. Just sad the kids are stable and the system may be willing to risk that just to do RU. @wendy_bird23 Yes your case does sound a lot like ours and we are confused as well, and very concerned for the kids well being especially now that we have such a strong bond. Teeny's BF sounds like he is doing better than ours though, ours is good with the kids, but he has VERY short visits once a week. Other than that working part time if that and has not had the kids in more than a year. Let BM to care for them even though she has her issues. Which makes me sick because he should have stood up and been the father they needed. Also, he hasn't even bothered in that whole time to get a place...not real promising if he truly wants them back. But he is their father and the kids do enjoy the short time they have with them. The problem is is he should be a fun uncle not a father IMHO... Hope your case works out for the best.  \n",
      "It's a very tough situation you're in and one that I am all to familiar with. My sister was having mental health issues with two small kids, checking her self in and out of the mental health facility every month or two because she 'couldn't handle the kids' anymore, they would come to us for a few weeks and go back. The BD decided at that point he was an alcoholic an going to go live in a sober living home, convienent timing (I still don't believe he is an alcoholic I think he just wanted attention, weird!) Anyway, their house was a disaster (laundry everywhere, dishes piled up, used diapers left around, reaked of smoking), my niece received a trauncy letter from school, my 3 y.o. nephew hardly talked and literally cried ALL of the time. We called CPS on multiple occasions over the last year, they investigated, but for some reason they always called before they were coming to investigate and my sister and their BD pulled it together. Finally last year I got a phone call to come pick up the kids again, she couldn't do it again. We called CPS at that point and told them the children were abandoned with us. It didn't just take one phone call though, it took multiple multiple very direct phone calls and finding the right language to use when you call. After almost a month CPS showed up at my house randomly one evening...They were confused by the whole situation...kids look good, you live in a great neighborhood and you're family, what are we suppose to do? But my point in doing all this was not to punish my sister, but to make it so the kids are more stable for now or permanetly while she figures out her issues, and to get the clock rolling in case she chooses not to figure it out so us and the kids aren't just dragged along until she decides she wants to do it again (now almost 8 months later, she hasn't done a **** thing). All in all my niece and nephew weren't in nearly as bad a situation as I hear some of you speak of on here. But IMHO they were in a position where they weren't being cared for the way parents should care for their children. It was the worst thing I ever had to do making that call, but I look back and know it was the right move no matter what happens. All I can say is be persistent, VERY VERY persistent. Use strong words when you call CPS if it is in fact the truth. And the best time to call is if the children are left with you or relatives for a long period of time, that worked for us at least. It may take time even a year or more, but if you truly feel strongly that these kids are not being cared for then it's worth putting in the time.  \n",
      "So yesterday we had our 6 month check in, as I posted in a previous post...BD asked for more time with the kids. Currently has only an hour and a half on Tuesday evenings. SW called this morning BD wants every Saturday 11-2...Are you kidding me? Right in the middle of the day so our whole weekend is screwed up, kids always come home in moods which will be nice...and the whole reason he wants 11 is because he can't get his butt out of bed any earlier...Your kids are up at 7am dude, how about you pick them up then??? I am livid!!! I didn't sign up for this, they are family, and I refuse to give up more time or have to call and make sure it's okay with him if we miss a Saturday so we can all go do something!! He did this not me!! So anyhow...I've put a call into our SW and said absolutely not, we are ridiculously busy and that is sooo inconvient...Me and my devoted boyfriend work full time, do online college courses full time, raise their kids (which includes driving them to the next city, so they can remain in their school for some sort of stability) and we are trying to be 25 and have a relationship of our own...All in all I said what I will agree to is every other Saturday 9-11 or 9-12....Now I'm just waiting to hear back...But the fact every Saturday right in the middle of the day was even suggested feels like a big F U to us....So annoyed.  \n",
      "I'm glad you all agree with me... I don't want to give up my weekends either, but then again us and the kids aren't home until 5:30 or 6 during the week days and after dinner, a bath, homeowork, some play time it's off to bed at 7:30 so its very hard to allow for any more week day visits since we are already doing visits every tuesday. I guess that's why I am willing to do every other Saturday, but first thing in the morning...Also, I am saying I want a confirmation phone call or text by 5pm on the Friday before his visit or it's not happeneing. Let me tell you how he had totally open visitations up until a few months ago, than he became very manipulative, told me to go to hell, it was my fault they're in this position and kept cancelling his visits...I did change my number at that point and no more visits besides Tuesday's. Now I'm just afraid we're going back to that point and it's been so good! Grrrrr..... And we're all family! Which baffles me....  \n",
      "fosteringkiddosI had no idea that I could say \"no\" to weekend visits. Probably because no caseworker (3 in the last 4 months) has told me that. I am on my first placement and guess at most everything... so when the visitation worker (not even a case worker) called and said that visits will be held on Saturdays.. from 9-12 (and birthmom is an hour away, so they are actually being held from 8-1 with drive time) I said.. \"okay\". Is it too late to refuse this? It sounds like you are in the same boat as us!!! Well the out come of our totally unresonable Saturday visits (in addition to the Tuesday visits we already have) was extremely positive. I used many people's advice and I said look weekends are a absolute not. I will agree to Friday, pick them up after school and have them home by dinner, I want a phone call to confirm each week by 5pm the day before. No call, no visit, phone call minutes late no visit. I was very firm and said I am more than happy to type up our schedule, but this is what works and parents have IMO hardly anything going on so they need to work around us, not vice versa. The SW said not a problem I will write it up and we were done. I was shocked there was no push back, that's a first!! So my advice is call be firm and get it changed if you can. Know exactly what you want and don't back down (that's what I am bad at, trying to make everyone happy), but at this point worry about guys' well being, the parents will make it work if they actually want to!! Good luck!  \n",
      "fosteringkiddosPS this forum is like a GOD SEND!!!!!!!! First off, I completely agree! I am doing kinship care and I feel like we know NOTHING and are told NOTHING, which I am learning tends to be typical for kinship...Lucky us! Second, I hope you guys are able to change your weekend visits. I was not willing to give up the 2 days I have each week to myself and to actually spend with the kids doing fun 'family' stuff. My opinion, if i am able to raise your kids, work full time and do college full time then you can make it work around my time as well. It's interesting I feel like since doing FC it has taught me to be much more direct and stand up for what I want even if it doesn't make someone else happy... Good thing?? Not sure yet, but at some point I have to worry about my self and my family and not everyone else, because believe me they don't care about me or my well being... What's sad is I am actually dealing with my own sister to, not just some stranger... (sigh)  \n",
      "Boys at that age are so much fun!!! Poor little man, must be very frightened. Hope it goes wonderful, lots of trains, cars and the Toy Story movie, that keeps are little guy content! Good luck.  \n",
      "This sounds a lot like my nephew (FS) when he first came to live with us about 7 months ago...he cried about EVERYTHING! He is three, but being that he is my nephew I knew that this was how he was able to get away with EVERYTHING growing up with his BM. We would not put up with him controlling the situation and 7 months later he is such a different kid, although he still has his moments. We do not have children of our own, yet, so we did not know what to do at first but we have learned consistency was the best remedy! When he feels like crying or screaming when he does not get his way we ask him to sit in his room until he is done and ready to use his words and talk like a big boy. Also, when he is clearly whining just to get his way we sometimes tell him 'we can't hear you, louder!' he then thinks this is funny and we are immediately able to turn his attention back to what he was doing. We have learned to always make him sit for meals even if he is not hungry, it took some time and patience at first, constantly having to put him back in his seat, but now he is doing awesome. We have also learned with dinner, tell him he doesn't get dessert if he doesn't finish and also using a timer at meals helps. He will drag it on as long as humanly possible if he can, up and down up and down (we of course give him an appropriate amount of time to eat, and often don't even have to use it now). These are just some of the tricks that have worked for us. And as one other person posted make it clear they don't get anything until the next meal/snack if they don't sit and eat...they learn quickly...Also, just doing little tricks like 'I bet you can't eat 5 green beans, let me see and count...' Kids seem to love little games like this...I must admit we still of course have our days and moments...good luck and I hope it gets better!  \n",
      "My 6 y.o. niece (FD) puts everything in her mouth and it drives us crazy!!! My nephew (FS) did it as well when they first moved in, but now 7 months later he has got much better, mind you he is only 3 though. Anyhow, my niece continues to do it so much of the time, we are constantly telling her not to. Mainly she chews on her hair (I've even threatened to shave her head!) but she also chews on all of the blankets in our house, her stuffies, even the dogs ear and leather coffee table. I thought maybe it was like a vitamin she was lacking, but she takes a daily vitamin or maybe a lack of salt, but don't think that's it either. Let me point out it seems to be mainly when she is concentrating, reading, watching TV, going to sleep. Any advice from anyone on why she would do this?!  \n",
      "We have a three, soon to be 4 year old that doesn't nap during the day, but goes to bed at 7:30pm and wakes up at 7:15am on week days and 8 - 8:30am on weekends. We tried the nap thing and he refused to go down and wouldn't sleep through the night if he actually did fall asleep. At day care and at home we do have like an hour to two hour quiet time break where we close the blinds dim the light and quietly watch a movie or play a quiet game, just to give him a break.I think it prob. depends on the kids and you just have to find your grove with them.  \n",
      "All I can say is that you are not alone and it is a wonderful thing you are doing for those kids whether they are able to stay with you permanently or not. I have had my niece (6) and nephew (3) through kinship care for just over 7 months. We had our 6 month review today and we were extended until Aug. which is more likely when they will either go back or possibly the Bioparents will get TPRed. I keep questioning if that happens am I ready to take them on full time, do I want to take them on full time? I had/have my whole life planned out and this wasn't part of it...I still want to travel, finish school and have a family of my own. Am I willing to change/adjust all that? I question everyday if this is the right thing for me and my devoted boyfriend and can we do adoption if it comes down to it? Then the 6 month review happened today and I thought what if they actually do go back, I don't know if I can handle that either, whether or not I want to admit they have become such a huge part of our lives (in a wonderful way), and our days revolve for the most part around them...It's such a tough call...and it's unfortunate that we are put into potential situations where we have to make them and/or accept the choices that are made for us...at the end of the day they're all just kids who didn't ask for this and you want to do the right thing...but what is the right thing?I wish you nothing, but luck in whatever decision you choose. I think no matter what it's tough and you're gonna question it.  \n",
      "I am so sorry for you and those poor children to have to deal with all of that... I know it can be so frustrating.We were told today that we need to increase visitation time with BD (after our 6 month review yesterday) I received a message from the SW this morning that he can only do Saturday right in the middle of the day... NO WAY will I agree.I took the advice from someone on this board, and it looks like a few people have mentioned it as well and I am saying one additional day during the week right after school, so they're home right before dinner and he has to call by 5pm the night before to confirm. No call no visit. That way we can make other plans if necessary. So I am interested to see how that plays out, but I am learning this time to stick to what I want, no if's and's or but's about it! Also, I am not bending to what I agree to either because give an inch and they take a mile, I thought you only had to deal with that with the children, but apparently it goes for their parents as well.Good luck with everything and I hope these poor kids quit getting disappointed, it's just so sad!  \n",
      "That makes me so sad for that little guy, but as dizzilee said maybe he was not allowed to in his home or maybe he was told boys/men don't cry. I would just keep making sure to let him know it's okay to be open about his feeling and it is okay to cry when your sad or hurt. Poor guy...  \n",
      "How exciting to have a little girl! And that is good the parents check in on her. Our CW was very good in the beginning (mind you she is like the 5th one for the same children), but in the last few months she does not follow up at all, hardly returns phone calls and has become extremely unflexible for visits. We are doing kinship care so I heard this can sometimes be the case when it's family members caring for the children, but it would still be nice to have some idea of what's going on and not be totally left in the dark. Also, GAL came over last week and was telling me all about the court process and where we will perhaps go from here and different things that are available to us and we had no clue, she said the CW should have told us these things. We definitely have had better luck with GAL at this point, for whatever that is worth... Good luck with everything!!!  \n",
      "AMEN! :-)Most important part in my opinion, is 'stop acting like 2 year olds, think of your kids first for once, and be honest!' I think there are so many of us on here that can absolutely agree with that!Hope things get better for you!  \n",
      "I don't know either, but I would sure as heck be calling someone, possibly even the local pd to find out. That would creep me out if they were at their school. I would prob. even let the school and/or teacher know who and who they cannot leave with. Good luck, hopefully it's nothing!  \n",
      "Had the 6 month review today for my niece and nephew. Decided not to go because you had to show up at 9am and just wait around in a city about 30 minutes away. Figured that it was prob. better I didn't go anyway because I would prob. be more annoyed than anything and no point in missing a day of work when I can use it for something better, like a child's sick day, hehe... Well we found out the case will be extended 6 months and that we go back towards the end of August (which I am sure will be here before we know it)! In some ways I am glad because I don't know if I could bare saying goodbye yet, but I still hope that their parents can get it together, for the children's sake and so we can go back to being Aunt and Uncle. Only other thing that changed is BD requested more visitation time (it is only one night a week right now for both parent for an hour and a half). The GAL told me this so now I am just waiting for the SW to call to confirm, but I will only agree to a couple hours on the weekend, every other weekend. I am not giving up more time, dealing with more kids emotions due to visitations or letting him go sit random places with the kids because he doesn't have a place yet...Little surprised and saddened that mom (my half sister) did not request any more time with them, but maybe it's for the best... So all in all it was a good day, I think, no big changes...now just waiting for August and the surprise trip we have planned for the kids to Disneyland in a month!! Yeee!!!!  \n",
      "I can't imagine what it's like going through having one of your FC go home... I am doing kinship care so even if they do go back I hope, 'hope' being the keyword, I will get to go back to being Auntie again...although the thought of not having them in my home and waking up to them everyday breaks my heart. I think if I was in your position I would absolutely keep something, along with the many wonderful photos and memories we have had and captured. I do know that for me I would need to send everything with them or pack up any extra belongings for awhile while I healed because the thought of looking into their empty rooms or finding their drawings, toys or stuffies would hurt. My heart goes out to you at this time and I hope you find comfort in something. You did a great thing for them! Take care!  \n",
      "As others have said if it is just her second night with you then I would cut her a bit of slack, she may still be having a rough time adjusting. We found that with whatever we decided we had to stick to it and after about a week everyone was on a schedule, they have their nights, but for the most part sleep wonderful.With our 3 y.o. we do bath, dessert, read a book of his choice in bed, ABC's, Numbers and then good night we love you, turn of the light and shut the door.His sister, 6 y.o. same type of routine, but she get's more stressed about going to bed, nightmares, and night terrors, although they have improved dramatically!! We got her an alarm clock/night light, and many stuffed animals...we do shower, dessert, book of her choice, then I turn off the light and lay in there for 5 minutes on the floor and we talk about the fun things during the day and what fun things we will do tomorrow. From there we say our good nights, we do a silly good dream ritual (it's silly to me, but she counts on it) we leave her door open and then we check on her 5 min later, than let 10 min go by, the 15 min etc. we rarely get past the 5 min. check. Although tonight was visitation night and she has been tossing ane turning for a good hour. Poor thing...Good luck in whatever you decide, but I definitely suggest sticking to it!  \n",
      "I hate that I feel this way, I have had my niece (6) and nephew (3) for just over 7 months and I am ready to throw in the towel. They are great kids who I love more than I think most average aunts love their niece and nephew...but I HATE THE SITUATION! I hate that their parents just don't care... I hate that they get to come over have fun and leave and that's what the kids remember. I hate that I have to put my life on hold why we wait to hear what might or might not happen. I hate to know this could get dragged on and on and on. I hate that I am 25 and can figure it out and they are 40 years old and can't. I hate that these kids have to be their kids. I hate that they act like they care, but if they really did than why aren't they doing a **** thing to make it right for their kids. They're lazy, that's the only reason they aren't, they like the single life with no kids and then they get to just visit and leave. The worst part of all, is knowing them and how they work, they will get it together just at the last minute an the kids will go back... we will have done all this and we're going to get our hearts broken. I honestly feel like I just want to call and be done...they aren't my kids and that is made clear everyday, why am I stretching myself so thin for this? I love them I truly do, but maybe I am just not cut out for this, this isn't the life I planned or the life I want...But I can't live with myself to tell the kids I just don't want to do it anymore, not because I can't because their parents have just put me in a spot that I don't want to... Sorry for the long vent...just so frustrating and I am sure some of you may be able to relate.  \n",
      "elizabeth30My fs parents both had bad psych evaluations and it did nothing. He was still ru when one of them started following the plan. I think it can help the sw if the parents do nothing but if they make any effort they can still get them back. That's what I am so scared of! My sister has supposed 'mental disabilities' (supposed because they have randomly appeared and I still don't believe it's not just her laziness) Anyhow...I'm so afraid because she is following her plan as well as her looser fiance and I am assuming that they are going to get their kids back, my niece and nephew. It's amazing that they only need to see them for an hour and a half each week (for almost a year) and somewhat follow a case plan and that they'll get them back...that proves nothing about being a better parent!!!! ...it's sad because their kids don't even want to go back, they want to stay with us! I mean I hope I am wrong, but the system seems to do no justice for these children in most cases. Especially during the first go around.  \n",
      "I know three year olds often repeat what they hear and will often say super random stuff, but recently my 3 year old nephew FS has told his sister and my significant other, his uncle, they are going to die. I don't know where he is hearing this and we definitely don't like that he is saying it. Should we be concerned or just ignore it? We tell him it's not nice and move on, but it's a little odd? I've never had kids so is this normal?  \n",
      "I am so sorry you are having to deal with that, but I know exactly what you are saying. We personally did not sign up to do foster care, but it was my niece and nephew so it was hard to say no. We just had our GAL come by the other day to see how the kids are doing because our 6 month review is coming up and when I asked if the parents would be getting more visitation time she indicated that, yes that will probably occur. I told her how I literally do not have the time due to working full time, going to school full time and just trying to live a somewhat normal 25 year old life. What she bascically told me in more words than less...it's a job and you get paid, you will need to do what you are told...I am at the same point as you I want to call and say come get them then. I am trying to do the right thing and get completely taken advantage of, IMHO. But it's hard when it's family and you love them so dearly... Arrrghhh. I hope it all works out for the best for you all!  \n",
      "HDMom In regard to lifechanges GAL's comment about this being a job you get paid for, that is such a huge widespread perception problem. Unless a FP is abusing the system (and I know there are some that do), there is no profit in this. I know that some great FP do have FK's in part to help them with their monthly bills, but they earn every penny. I so agree with you, we have no issue with paying our bills and had no reason to do it for that reason, we did because we are family and it's the right thing... We spoil my niece and nephew rotten if we have any extra each month, which we typically do...as a matter of fact we are surprising them with a surprise Disneyland trip next month!!! As you said it's them and the little moments that make it all worth it. When I got done brushing my niece's hair this morning she wrapped her arms around me, gave me a big 'ol hug and said 'i love you.' Great feeling!  \n",

My niece who is 6 currently lives with me and is adamant that she does not want to go back and live with mom and/or dad. She is okay if they visit the once a week like they do, but nothing more. She almost gets to the point of anger when it is mentioned that mom and dad are tyring to get better and you may have to go back to living with them. Has anyone experienced this and is this at all taken into consideration when determining if a child will stay or go back?  \n",
      "You all kind of have the answer I was expecting. What is interesting is the CW told me completely different, she said of course she would have a say and that her opinion would be completely considered.@Crazy_Woman: I have never heard her say it to her parents (who is my sister) I think she has a fear of hurting their feelings. I never ask her where she wants to live either, but I do tell her you will be staying until March and then we will see what happens, now I am saying September because we know we've been extended 6 months. I like to let her know that there is a chance that she will be going back, but she will always have a place to come and stay here if she needs to and she will still get to come and visit (perk of kinship care, or so I hope). She just gets upset and says she is not leaving and wants to live here. I just reassure her that I will love her no matter what happens, but it isn't up to me. She says she doesn't mind that they visit, but that she wants to stay here. So I don't think she is saying it to simply keep me happy...but I do agree she may be trying to protect feelings. We just try to be very open that we will not ever be mad at her if she wants to/has to go back, we might be sad not seeing her everyday but it will be okay because we will still see each other often.It just breaks my heart, that neither her or I may have a choice in the matter...and that if she truly does not want to go back and has to I won't be able to say a word...What's even more sad is the simple fact the don't even ask for their parents, that just baffles me....What really was going on for a kid to just not seem to care (although I am sure they do, but you know..)  \n",

Our biomom smells horribly of smoke and the doctor isn't thrilled that the baby has to be around her but he says if smoking was grounds for losing your baby - there'd be a lot more kids in foster care! He says when they are that little their little lungs really struggle with any smoke exposure! I do know that if the baby was having a reaction to the visits like you described that the doctor told mw hw would make her stop visits until he could tolerate it.We were told the exact same thing when we took our two young ones to the doctors, they said it being on the parents clothes, in the car, in their hair and even on their skin can be second hand smoke for little ones. You would never think it though... I can't stand when their parents (my sister & the BD) show up for visits reaking of smoke and our furniture smells of it after they leave as well...

I would even goes as far as to letting everyone know that my nephew would not be going with that person and if they have to find a new one for visitations than so be it...

      "Wanted to see what some of your experiences are that have claimed foster children on taxes before. I foster my niece and nephew in CA. They came to live with me August 6, 2011. Officially placed Sept. 16. We also had them at least one day of every weekend since Jan. 2011 as well as 3 weeks in Jan and one in Feb. of 2011. They lived with their mom the additional time, dad visited. BM says she will not be doing taxes, BD did not reply to my e-mail when I asked him. I know in CA you have to have had the kids at least 6 months to claim them. We are right on the fringe. What would you do?  \n",
      "Thanks for everyone's input. It is so close to being 6 months if not a little over. My sister said she will not claim them and technically the BD only had them in Jan 2011, so he really can't/shouldn't be claiming them. It would be such a huge change in my taxes I am considering asking them to sign a letter saying they won't claim them and that I can (maybe even offer a little kick back, they're money greedy, so I'm sure it will work). That way if I get audited I'll have a signed notarized letter by them saying they wouldn't claim them because I had them more than 6 months. Including other documentation. We'll see!  \n",
      "I do not plan on doing that after researching more...I can no longer delete that post though....Ooops, need to do more research before positng, clearly! Sorry. @Larue - you say you're an auditor? Out of curiosity, both parents say they will for sure not be claiming the kids. I have had them since Aug. 6th (officially place by CPS in Sept.) and then I had them for a couple two - three week periods throughout the year. Which do in fact ad up to just over 6 months. I guess what I am so unsure of is do these couple week periods I had them count or the month before they were 'officially' placed by CPS count? They weren't officially placed with me by an agency during these times, but they were staying with me because their parents could not care for them.  \n",
      "When my niece (6) began living with us she had terrible nightmares and night terrors. They have since got much better, but they also tend to flare up after visitation time. If it's any help here is what we have done...Got her multiple stuffed animals to have in bed with her, an alarm clock that also is a fairly bright night light, we leave the hall closet light on. Before bed I read her a book, then I lay in her room on the floor for 5 minutes and we talk about the fun things we did for the day and that we will be doing tomorrow, anything happy, then from there I kiss her good night and I told her when I rub her forhead and say 'Good dreams, good dreams, good dreams' she will have good dreams...and she does it back to me (just something I made up, but if I forget to do it she lets me know, it has become very important to her). On nights she does wake up and get me, I tell her she is fine and that nothing here will hurt her and me and her uncle are here to protect her, as well as our little dog, hehe, I tuck her back in and I lay on her floor for 5 more minutes. This stuff seems to work for us, but it has taken just about 7 months to get to this point. I would definitely not suggest letting them stay in your room because give a kid an inch and they seem to take a mile. So even if there is no bad dreams going on they may be pulling that just to get a chance to snuggle up in your bed! Good luck!  \n",
      "I personally have not have children of my own yet, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I have been fostering my 6 y.o. niece for about 7 months now. I kinda feel like your story was a bit like ours. I just kept sticking to our rules, letting her know right from wrong and keeping boundaries, telling her how much we loved her and really praising her when she did good things. I at one point thought there was no hope she is going to turn out just like her parents and i also felt like the best parts of the day was when she was not there and dreaded coming home to have to deal with her. But truly one day about a month and a half ago something just clicked. She has been wonderful ever since. Today we even had a girls day and went and got stuff to decorate her room, that would have NEVER happened two months ago... Good luck with your situation, but my advice would be just hang in there and reallllllly praise the good moments, but stick to your structure.  \n",
      "I am doing kinship care for my niece (6) & nephew (3) as well. I agree that it seems much more relaxed compared to what some true foster parents go through on here. I personally refer to them as my niece & nephew unless I have to refer to them as my foster children, to make the point of why they live with me. I don't ever say it in front of them though. I think I would prefer to keep them sheltered from the situation as much as possible. Maybe that's me being the protective auntie I always have been to them! (I don't like the fact that they could be teased for this or the feeling that it could bring along)We have had them almost 7 months and we do anything we want pretty much when it comes to cutting hair, what clothes to wear, where we take them (within reason) etc. We've never been told a thing otherwise. Their birthmom (my half-sister) and their BD come over to my house to visit weekly. We are no longer close what so ever and there is a lot of tension between us, but I don't think they speak up in terms of our parenting job because they know we are doing a much better job (if i can speak for myself, hehe) and their children are safe and with family that would give the world to them to protect them.Nice to meet another kinship caregiver, good luck though everything, I know it has been a rough road for us.  \n",

Is this normal for this age? You try to tell him or ask him something and if he doesn't like it, you're done...he's screaming crying and there is no stopping him. I know when he lived with his mom it was over the top and it has got a bit better, I know his birthmom always coddled him every time this happened, but after almost 7 months I would think it would be getting a bit better. Especially because he NEVER get his way with us and I do not like to coddle that behavior. We simply ask him to go sit in his room until he is done and ready to act like a big boy and use his words. Can someone tell me, will he grow out of this, is there something more we could be doing. I should prob. also add he was a bit speech delayed due to a cleft pallet and his parents not getting him the help he needs, but since he has been with us he is talking a ton... The whining and crying is driving me crazy, please help!:confused: :confused:  \n",
      "I foster my niece (6) & nephew (3). We really have never had any family issues, other than my older half sister. Our family is quite large and we all live quite close together. When I heard my niece and nephew were going into foster care I immediately said I would take them, they're kids and we are family. That's what you do right? Well it's been 6 months and family members are constantly questioning why i would do this and keep telling me i need to give up and live my life. I to some degree feel pretty isolated from family i once thought I was very close to. My reasoning to why....people just don't want to be bothered. My sister has had a track record of making people's lives a pain in the butt so they want nothing to do with it (even though it's not the kids fault), she is lazy and others feel they don't want to play into that. Finally, I will end with the fact of how much i love my niece and nephew, but it has been hard adjusting my life. We know we will for sure have them to at least Sept. and have talked about maybe having to be done at that point (put the kids in a 'real' foster home). Not because anything the kids have done, but for the simple fact my sister does not want to make it easy on us, she is doing nothing to help her situation, will not give up custody and this could drag on for quite some time. So that's my thoughts from a family member perspective. It's just horrible to me the children get punished for their parents mistakes. Good luck to you!  \n",
      "You and Teeny are definitely in my thoughts. I completely agree that a child who has been away from their parents this long should at least be transitioned back into their parents care, if RU is the plan. But overall I really hope for Teeny and your sake that the judge really looks at the whole case and does what is best for that little girl... Good luck!  \n",
      "I am wondering how some of you deal with post visit acting out? My three (almost 4) year old nephew is definitely having some strong feelings when BM and BD come for their weekly visits. When BM & BD are around he always gets his way, he can yell, scream, whine, hit, doesn't matter he gets exactly what he wants. We have been working very hard with him and trying to teach him this is not appropriate behavior, we tell him we use our words and talk in a calm voice. I try and make sure BM and BD are following these guidelines as well, but they just don't care, they get to leave at the end of the visit! (Grrrr.) So last night was definitely a long visitation, nephew was completely acting out, during and afterwards. Might I add he is typically pretty sweet, until BM & BD show up. After they left last night nephew was screaming at us, kicking and punching. We had him go sit in his room until he could calm down, which he continued to act out, so we told him no Mario Kart (that's his reward in the evening for good behavior during the day). What I don't like is I know he is having strong feelings towards the visit and I don't like to punish him for this. I explained to him once he calmed down we don't act that way, we use our words and talk nicely to eachother, and it's okay to be sad or mad but we don't hit, kick, punch or scream. It somewhat helped, but i am wondering if anyone else has a different way of dealing with this? A way to show them it's not okay to act out, but still be sympathetic to the fact he may be just having very strong feelings to the visitation?  \n",
      "Yes, it sounds like a normal 3/4 year old reaction to not getting their way. We are doing kinship for my 3.5 year old nephew and he is very demanding and throws a fit when he is told no. I think it's a lot to do with his age, but i also know his mom (my sister) and she never told him no and the crying and fits immediately got him what he wanted because she couldn't deal with it. Whether or not it's a learned trait from his past or just his age, you're the boss and be adamant. We make our guy go sit in his room until he can act like a big boy and calm himself down. At that point we explain why he is in his room and have him tell us back why. Then we tell them next time let's try it this way and that we still love him, but that's not how we act... Keep on it though because the minute you give in they will try it next time to! Good luck!  \n",
      "I know this is probably absolutely petty, but still makes me...well I don't know what it makes me...sad, angry, frustrated, annoyed??? I have been fostering my niece and nephew (half-sister's kids) for almost 7 months...The last two days my niece has been talking about the amazing Valentine she made for her Dad at school and then this evening we had to sit down and make this 'special' one for mom, which of course ended up me having to do a large part of it. It's so frustrating to know their parents come once a week for an hour and a half with no other contact and they get these extravagant Valentines, and well us as their aunt & uncle/caregivers get nothing... It makes me annoyed since I pretty much can't stand my sister, to have to help make her a Valentine and hear ALLLLLL about it, but sad that her kids still think so highly of her yet dream of a life they will probably never have. Of course I would never voice this to my niece, I just smile and tell her how wonderful it is and I am sure that mom will love it. Is this horrible of me to feel this way? Plus to top it all off visitation (aka family fun night) is tomorrow evening after a full day of work...so no special Valentine's dinner with my number one guy! Grrrrrrr!!!  \n",
      "Thank you all for your responses...It makes me feel better to know that I am not the only one feeling this way. You all make such valid points and help me to see this in a different way and that is just what I needed. Sometimes it's difficult to see different points of views through your own feelings. It's amazing, I always thought I was a strong person, but doing kinship care is testing that on soooo many different levels. I love these kids to death, but sometimes I'm ready to throw in the towel and be 25 again with no kids, no worries. I am overly impressed with those of you who take this on just to do better for children that you didn't even know before they were placed with you. Thank you all again for the support and well wishes! :-)  \n",
      "We we're never specifically told one way or another, but we are doing kinship care. We do always put the phone on speaker if the parents call because there has been times where mom has said things she shouldn't be to her 6 y/o. Plus it was nice to know what was being said because often the children ended the conversations and were in quite the moods, so at least we would have an idea why. So my recommendation, depending on their age would definitely be to either in or at least be present when you can hear the children's side.  \n",
      "I am so sorry you are having to go through all that, I completely understand that the 'unknown' can be so frustrating. I hope it all works out for the best for you and each of those children!  \n",
      "I definitely can relate with what you are going through. First I would definitely get her into a doctor like it sounds like you are doing... Second i know when we were placed with my nephew through kinship care he was just over 3 and did not talk much himself. Just did a lot of whining and crying. Now I had it a bit easier because I knew his background and i knew he had born with a cleft palate that was repaired when he was 1, but he should have done speech classes and a lot of help from his parents, but neither happened so he never really began talking. His mom (my sister) simply followed him around, but never really interacted with him or talked to him like a child needs to be. Now 7 months later he has been living with us and it a total motor mouth, doesn't stop talking. I am not sure if it's because he's in a relaxed enviorment or simply that we are constantly talking to him and telling him everything that's going on? We did also take him to a speech therapist, in California it's free through your school district when a child turns 3 and the first time she had concerns, but now she feels he's doing great. Her suggestions to us... 1. Tell him constantly what you are doing...we are putting on your pants, one leg in, other leg in, i am cooking dinner, putting chicken in the pan etc. etc. 2. Read to him...lots! Hop on Pop, Brown Bear, repetitive type books. 3. Now that he has started talking, he sometimes doesn't use speech correctly or words in the right order and she has told us don't stop him, but instead when he's finished correct him. He say's 'I put the table on the truck' we say 'Yes good job you put the truck on the table.' As for the bottle, I would maybe try some fun bright sippy cups. Maybe wean her off the bottle, but when she uses the sippy cup tell her how cool it is and what a big girl she is bring. Our little man seems to respond very well to doing knew things when we really praise him and tell him he is such a big boy now! Good luck!  \n",
      "How frustrating that must be for you to hear, and so sad for that child. That's when you question how CPS is doing their job? I guess maybe he could have been hiding it, but still a bit odd they had no other way of detecting it. I wish you and that poor child all the best...  \n",
      "I am so sorry you are having to deal with that. We are dealing with that a bit ourselves. We are doing kinship care for my niece and nephew and still 6 months later I get e-mails from my sister completly denying any wrong doing and telling us that the whole reason we're in this situation is becasue of us and the things we've said. SOOOOO NOT TRUE! It's hard to hear that stuff and definitely makes you question whether it could be true or not, human nature I guess. But at the end of the day you have to realize that your just tyring to help and have to take things that are said by others with a grain of salt. Clearly these grandparents know something is not right, and clearly they need some help to come to that realization. Maybe they're voicing their frustrations because they see a little bit of their past in what their own children are doing to their grandchildren? We could prob. guess reasons all day... I guess what's most sad to me when they don't consider how it's affecting/will affect the children in the situation or even the caregiver for that matter. I just hope you can seperate yourself from what they are saying because it does become soooo draining...they probably wont ever get you're just trying to do what's best. With that said I hope that things work out for the best...  \n",
      "I completely understand what you are going through. I am fostering my niece and nephew. My nephew is young and doesn't completely understand what is going on, on the other hand my niece is a very bright 6 y/o. We to have tried to answer her questions at a very age appropriate level. I hate that I can't make it all go away and be better for them. But I have learned just trying to be open and honest with them (again age appropriate) and always trying to make sure they know we love them and will always be here for them no matter what they go through or feeling. And also just telling them that sometimes parents want to do better for their children than they can do, and it's not the child's fault... Just my two cents...I don't think there is a right answer though, it's painful no matter what and unfair especially to the poor children who go through these situations. You just can't enforce enough how much you love her and will be there for her no matter what.  \n",
      "This sounds an awful lot like my niece (6) & nephew (3) who I am currently fostering. I do not yet have kids of my own (and they're making me reconsider having any at all), but I thought the way they were acting was somewhat normal for their age. Boy was I wrong now that I am talking to parents. My 6 & 3 year old are completely unable to play together or help each other, they just yell and fight, the 6 year old is extremely demanding and then goes into a complete tantrum when it doesn't go her way. Our 3 year old is better about playing together, but does the same whining and crying you are speaking of, OVER EVERYTHING! You look at him wrong, play with him wrong, don't hear him right...anything he cries! Now I had the priviledge of knowing how he was brought up and both of them are acting exactly how they were brought up. Whine and scream and you get what you want. What we have been trying to do is set small bits of time aside and having them play together 15-20 minutes..trying to stay in the background, but explain how to act towards one another and what we do in different situations. We try to explain to the 6 y/o that sometimes younger children don't understand like we do, but she could really help by showing him how to do things...she likes being useful! I have also learned be specific when asking them to do something. Before I'd say 'can someone turn of the TV' it turned into a huge fight. Now I switch off and make sure I specify who I want to do what. As for the tantrums, we make them sit in there room and calm down and then we sit down and talk with them about why they are in there, what we can do different and that we still love them. It's helped, but even after 6 months we have a long way to go. Good luck in a very hard situation!  \n",
      "That's very sad when you hear of these types of situation. I don't know if there is anything you can do to help your friend if she's not willing to be helped...she is an adult an unfortunately can make her own decisions, even if they are horrible. Although I would definitely report it to a child protective agency if there is abuse going on with her daughter or even if front of her. No child should have to live through that, in my opinion. Good luck and I hope your friend does what's best for her, or if not at least her daughter.  \n",
      "We are coming up on our 6 month review court date. We have already been told that nothing will be changed and that we will for sure be extended an additional 6 months. We are doing kinship care for my niece (6) and nephew (3). I was wondering if we can expect anything more to happen or what we should expect at all? We were also told we do not have to go...should we go though? Any input from anyone who has BTDT would be great! Also, has anyone had experience with children going back before the 12 month review? It's almost been made to seem like the kids can only go back at review time, but can their parents request to go to court to get them back in between reviews? Thanks again, I feel we have been left in the dark by the whole system.  \n",
      "Thanks for the info. It definitely sounds like we should go which is very interesting because I feel as if the social worker is really pushing the fact that we do not have to go...hmmm! As for caregiver reports or handbooks we definitely have not been provided this or asked for these items? We are in Cali. maybe the process is different? Or maybe it is because we are doing kinship, it seems like we definitely don't go through the same process or have the same guidance as regular FP's in the area.  \n",
      "6 months ago my niece (6) and nephew (3) were placed with us. We thought it was a very temporary thing when it began, a month or so at max. All of a sudden one day CPS showed up at our door. They had received an annonymous call that the BM and BF had left the children in our care. BM (34) claims she is mentally ill (my sister, never had mental issues until now) and BF (39) was living is a sober living home (wasn't even aware he had a drinking issue).  Both have seemed like good parents until this year. BF lost job, BM refuses to get one, they had no where to live because crappy credit and they had screwed family/friends. And frankly I think they got a glimpse of what no kids was again and kinda liked it. They get to visit, have fun, leave and not deal with a **** 'real' thing.  Now 6 months later I still have their two kids and we just found out for sure we will have them an additional 6 months. I love them dearly, but I am not sure how much more I can take. I was just starting out my life, going to school, working, bought my first house, planning on getting married and starting a family of my own and now this...  What's hard is weekly family visits, at my house, having to see my sister and the children's father makes me sick to my stomach. The kids are in horrible moods afterwards. Having to comply with CPS, whether it be taking the kids to the dr., trying to go on a simple vacation, mandatory meetings, anything dealing with school, it's all a pain in itself. They are good kids, but they are so much like their parents in so many ways...and that's becoming hard to accept.  It also frustrates me to the core knowing I am busting my butt and giving up so many parts of my life to do what's right for these kids and their parents don't seem to give a ****. What's crazy is their parents are much older than me to, but i honestly feel like they enjoy seeing us struggle...for them it's like 'look see how it feels' when in reality it's different in so many ways. They didn't have CPS to deal with and they are their kids.  I guess it's just hard when you know the parents, you feel they are really just being lazy and taking advantage of the whole situation and system, yet you want to do what is right for the kids, because they are kids and you love them. But at what point is it just too much to handle anymore?  \n",
      "You are very right, family sucks big time sometimes. You try and do what's right, but it's the kids and I that are getting punished. I do hate to do it, but that's what we have been considering, is telling them at 12 months we are through. Whether or not we really put the kids in foster care, well I don't know...but there is talk of even extending this whole mess to 18 months, because they parents are having a hard time getting a place, PAY OFF YOUR DEBTS AND GET A JOB! But neither of them are working real hard at doing that. I don't know if I could play 'Mommy' full time. A few months ago I would have said for sure, but my sister and her boyfriend have made it clear they will not give up custody and it seems like having their rights removed will be very hard, because even the social worker has said she doesn't even really get why this is a case. The kids do love us and have said they would like to stay with us, but then again they're young and whoever is more fun with at that moment is who they want to be with. Plus they are so much like their parents it's hard sometimes, the talking back, being negative, but more importantly they just have no common sense and it drives us crazy! I love them so much, but had it not been family I probably wouldn't have said okay...I just don't want them to be punished for their lazy parents and I don't want to punish them for my own selfish reasons, but I don't know if I can have my sister and her bf around for another week let alone possible for years.  \n",
      "We have considered doing the visits somewhere else, but it is very hard because both my boyfriend and I work 8-5 during the week and we were told if we agree to a day we have to make it work no matter what. So we didn't want to make it during the weekend so we chose Tuesday evenings. The visit isn't until 5:30 and ends at 7 and the kids that take showers, finish homework and we try to have them in bed by 7:30. If we chose to do visits else where we had to provide the transportation and take them to a city that's about 25 minutes away, more like 45 with week night traffic. So at our home was easier driving wise...although maybe not otherwise.  Out of curiosity, MomInCorazon, what was your experience like with kinship care? I feel like the system has made us into the bad guys and do nothing, but help and help the parents...it's very frustrating. Especially to know we are working so hard to do the right thing and I know my sister and her boyfriend are just 'hanging' out not doing a **** thing. At what point do you accept family or not, kids or not, maybe we just can't take it anymore? I feel like I have always been a strong person, but I am very quickly loosing hope, and that makes me feel horrible...  \n",
      "Thank you everyone, you have sure given me a lot to consider. But I am glad I have people that understand, because I am not one to give up, especially on 2 children that I care about so deeply, but maybe this is a lesson, I need to stand up and say how it's going to be or accept that maybe I just can't fix this situation. For all of m 25 years life it's been cleaning up my 34 year old sisters messes, that's not how it's suppose to be. Unfortunately it's her two kids that take the brunt. @luvbeingamom - I wish we had it easier like that, I wish they could do what was right for their children. But even just last week my sister was saying we were why the situation is like it is...At this point I think I need to say we are done at 12 months unless they TPR...we can't just keep going on and on and on...I can't keep putting myself through this. I want to start a life of my own, have kids of my own (although I am quickly reconsidering because of how tough this has been) and unless they can be 'our' kids then I have to 'let them sink or swim' as one of you said. It's just hard to accept the kids didn't choose this life...  \n",
      "As much as he says he doesn't want you in there, my guess, he prob. does. I would suggest staying with him, when he's ready he will calm down and come to you. Maybe just let him know you are there and if he has anything he wants to ask or tell you you'd be happy to try an answer or listen. Maybe get him a snuggly blanket or stuffed animal as well....Just my 2 cents...hope he calms down soon. Poor guy.  \n",
      "I have been fostering my niece and nephew for about 6 months and it amazes me when I see the leaps and strides they've made... My 6 year old niece has never been affectionate and just this past weekend we were watching a movie and she snuggled right up with me on the couch, such a great feeling to know she trusts me. My 3 year old nephew didn't hardly talk when he came to live with us and just this last week we went for a second evaluation on his speech and they said he has improved so much since the last evaluation that they are recommending speech classes at this point! Seeing him grow into a little man is the best feeling and he's been potty trained 1 week now! As hard as some days can be it truly is the little things that make it all worth it.  \n",
      "I was hoping to get input from other foster parents...I am 25 years old and my niece (6) and nephew (3) were placed with me about 6 months ago as foster children. The mother (my sister) is 'mentally disabled', their father in a sober living home. We are coming up on our 6 month review very soon. So far nothing has changed with either parent. Except for the fact the biological dad had a heart attack last week (39) and claims he no longer will be able to work. He was pretty much our only hope for getting the kids back and building a decent life. I am fairly certain that at the end of this 12 month process neither parent will care enough to have done anything to get these children back. It makes me sick! What is the hardest part is do we adopt them or find them a new home? My boyfriend and I love them so much, but this whole process has been an absolute nightmare and the fact that is family I don't forsee it ever being 100% normal. Do we suck it up and adopt them if it comes down to it?, do we be selfish after a year and find them a new home so we can continue building the life we planned to? I just don't know. They are great kids and I am so torn.  \n",
      "Thank you for all the replies, I am sorry I did not find this site sooner! It's such a tough thing to go through with so many tough decision and no one truly understands how emotionally draining it is until the go through it themselves. I do agree that I would never adopt them unless I truly wanted them as my own or if I couldn't support them the way they needed to be. And neither of those are an issue. Although I do worry about the future, and having children of my own (especially because I always said i didn't want more than 2 :-D ). I also wonder what do E & M's future hold, especially with what they have gone through? I know what I went through growing up with their mom as a kid and it was horrible and what if they go through those issues as well, can we handle it, would I want to take the change of exposing my children to that. Also, I am scared their parents may try and keep contact and I do not want them part of my life. I know it's a lot of 'what if's', but selfishly I still have them. It's been a long road, but as we've said through the whole thing it's not the kids that are the tough part it's everything else that comes along with it at the moment. I guess I just want to know that if it does come down to adoption that things get easier from there? I love these kids and want the best for them. But who knows maybe their parents will get them back, although I doubt it.  \n",
      "Thank you everyone, it's so nice to hear others input that are facing or have faced the sames issues and choices. I just received an e-mail today from the BM that said she plans to move them to a shelter and then the CW called to say the BF is exempt for now from completing the classes assigned to him because of the heart attack and until he gets surgery. The CW told me that because of this there is a good chance it will be extended the additional 6 months at the 12 month review. Grrrrr! If they haven't been able to do a thing in the last almost 7 months why would anything change now. I get a heart attack is a big thing, but he didn't have the heart attack up until 2 weeks ago. With the BM saying she is going to put them in a shelter really makes me realize how much I care for the kids and want to protect them, I will do my best not to let them leave our perfectly good home in one of the best school districts to just go live in a shelter. No child deserves to be moved around like that. So frustating...It's the 'unknowns' that get me more than anything! Thanks for listening! \n",

      "Would you all then agree that Scripture is most often interpreted based on any one individual's experience? No matter the size of a congregation, it would seem to me that there are exactly that same number of interpretations of sermons and so forth. And, our understandings and feelings regarding such are so very dependant on our own lives and past. I can read the Bible over and over amd sometimes I am simply struck by something I swear I have never read before. It suddenly makes sense to me or the lesson \"meant\" by whhat i am reading changes. And though I honestly believe that there are just as many interpretations of the Bible as there are people to read it, I do believe that there are fundamental rules set forth by our Lord... love being the first. If everything you do is truly done in love for all God's creation, then what else is there really to worry over? Not a whole lot... I know that may sound really simple of me, but it has made my life so much easier. I just try to do right and be kind...to love. As a teacher I always made an effort to be knowledgeable of the fundamental beliefs of other religious groups. I can't say I know of one I encountered that would not fit into this very simple rule... Would it be wrong to say that no matter the religion most Higher Power's ask us to love one another?  \n",
      "Would you please pm me with any info you have. Thanks.  \n",
      "Sorry that happened to you. But, I disagree that we are in denial here. We know that there are same sex couples with children here. They must post about post adoption issues on a specific forum. I think that is right anyway...  \n",
      "That is so cool. And, I am so glad I happened upon this thread as your avatar is beautiful. I am always too slow to get to see the pics of your beautiful children.  \n",
      "I have done that a thousand times. As an adoptee I have the privalege of refusing to accept any of my family's \"problems\" because we fail to share DNA. HAHA! I JUST told my cousin that I was so sorry that his terribly weak immune system gives him allergies and he can not have all the great stuff I can have (by the way, I happened to fail to tell him about the things I am allergic to just to get hom b/c he always gets me). I told him that I, on the other hand, have a more healthy set of cells from persons unknown but definately not allergic. We ROARED with laughter and then i fessed up about my allergies! btw... My own adopted son has inherited his Mommy's chronic condition of I-leave-my-shoes-everywhere-itis... Oh well... So much for nature. And, did somebody say \"stubborn like your mother?\"  \n",
      "I hope she feels better soon too. This was really scary for me when it happened as well. Let us know if we can help in any way at all.  \n",
      "What a beauty! She truly is just so pretty already! Congratulations!  \n",
      "I have to agree with the suggestions toward thriftiness. I made huge errors in judgement paying too much for baby stuff. Why can't we just listen to our mothers even when we are mothers...They really grow right out of those clothes whether they cost 5 or 50 dollars and baby bedding is pretty much useless. All you really need is a sheet, matress cover, matress and crib. LOL... I had to learn the hard way though...  \n",
      "That is one beautiful boy!  \n",
      "We continue to pray for you. Please know that there are so many behind you willing to do anything at all to help you. Just let us know.  \n",
      "I am sorry someone hurt your feelings or made you angry. It is hard to have your feelings hurt like that, even more when it concerns your children, and it hurts just as much regardless of the other person's intent. i hope you have a better day tomorrow...  \n",
      "I haven't been through this as a mom yet, but I thought I might share some advice as a teacher. Most children are just about as nervous as their parents during this transitional period. And, they will definately pick up on your anxiety if you really let it show. A first time pre-k child will cry for a very short amount of time once you leave. We encourage our parents to make certain to tell their children that they will be back to get them and when and leave the building. We would hate for the child to have to go through another crying spell because they spotted mom or dad in the hallways. They really do very well once introduced to their peers and the structure of the classroom. It really is such a healthy experience. Good luck. I know I will be just as nervous when ds does it for the first time as well.  \n",
      "You have to do what is in your heart, in my opinion. Is your heart still telling you that you want to love this child as your own? If it is, then the answer is simple. Whatever comes with the child is just part of the deal after that. I don't know you, but I bet she will be worth what ever it is you have to do both before and after. Too many times, I have let my fear keep me from doing something. But, when I adopted my son I pulled out all the stops and faced all those fears head on. I am so happy I did now.  \n",
      "That is way cool. One of my favorite outfit's on my ds is a simple white onesie with \"I am proof of magic\" on it.  \n",
      "I am really just at a loss on this one and I hope that you all don't think I am over-reacting here. But, I have not been able to sleep or eat lately and I can feel the anxiety rising every minute. DS starts daycare Monday. I am finally going back to work. It is not like I don't want to go back to work. I actually think it is going to be quite nice having some adults to talk to during the day (even though I am a teacher and spend most of my time with 3rd graders...). I have been home with my son for almost a year now and so I know he is well attached and knows his home and all of that. So, why am I freaking out about leaving him like this. I was fine with it originally, but now is quite the different story. I have left him before during the day as well. We have always had a nanny here to help with him. But, three or four hours has been my limit and then I miss him too much and have to come home. And we thought about keeping the nanny but ds really needs the socialization during the day. The nanny just can't provide that. I am just freaking out that he is going to be too upset or not eat or not nap or not play with the other kids or not get the adult attention he needs or... do you all see where this is going? This is crazy, right? I mean, I researched this place like nobody's business. I have been there numerous times. I know people whose kids have had wonderful experiences there. It is one of the best day school'd in the city. But, I don't want to leave my baby there. This is total codependency right? Ok...so I know this is just really stupid. He'll be fine. I am the one with the problem here, not him. But, does this get any easier? I know I can't be the only mother ever to have felt this way, right? Somebody, please help!  \n",
      "Thanks Kay, Summer and Leigh. I am a bit upset that I won't get to spend a lot of time at the care facility with him. I have already majorly pushed my luck with this job by requesting a late start date. They accepted that before I signed my contract, so that is ok. There is just no way I can ask for any more than they have already given me. I agree that in these situations it is best to have someone else bring them. Not gonna happen though. Not to worry. I am a total champ at not falling apart until I am in the car alone. I find the job share idea very interesting. I have never heard of it. May have to check that out. Thanks so much again. It really helps so much to just voice your fears sometimes.  \n",
      "A few weeks ago (I may have posted this already) he said something like \"Momma, at first today I thought I would miss you and I would cry. But then I forgot all about you!\" and he beamed with pride. These are the bittersweet moments of parenting, and you will have your share of them. Ahhh! That is so funny, but would send me over the edge, I am sure. What a cutie pie you must have and tons of laughs at home from your witty little guy. Basically when you drop a child off at daycare, they are on their own emotionally. Yes, their physical, social and mental needs may be met but they do not have a person there that is there for them emotionally. Is this bad? I ask myself, isn't it okay because other needs that she has are getting met? I am not sure but suffer with it on a daily basis and question whether or not my child is getting what she needs. When I walk into daycare I see a lot of kids just roaming around. Some seem so lost. Some talk to me because maybe no one has really paid attention to them all day. Oh, Bella's mom. It shouldn't be like this at all. Perhaps I could suggest looking into other placement if this is the case for your DD. I researched the day schools in this area very well to make certain things like this wouldn't happen. I can't imagine the women who will be taking care of him and his class not holding these children and bonding with them emotionally. Thank you for your warning though. It helps to know what to watch for.  \n",
      "Tomorrow is the day! I am just not ok. I just do not like this. On one hand, I want to just say forget it and stay home with him and then send him a couple of times a week to socialize. Then, I am concerned about the commitment I made to this school. Then, I think, this school is not as important as my son. Who knows what tomorrow will bring. Did I say \"basket case\" yet?  \n",
      "I know this must be very difficult Tina. I have never been in your shoes, i.e. domestic adoptionn or this exact situation, and so all I can do is assume regarding the levels of your stress and distress. So, all I can say is how sorry I am that you are having to deal with this. After all of that which we went through to get ds, I do now believe that evrything works out well in the end. It is just so hard to think about the end when you are stuck in the middle of such hardship. We will keep you, your family, both birthmothers, and both babies in our thoughts and prayers. God bless.  \n",
      "I would let her lead the way for you. Is she able to initiate contact in this way? Perhaps you could just let her know the door is always open and let her decide how often to use it. Just my two cents.  \n",
      "I am, of course, always most thankful for my child. I can not seem to understand how this one little boy can still leave me breathless every time I look at him. And, after my family, one of the most awesome people I know is my best friend. She is a pillar of strength and doesn't know it, beautiful and would never believe it, and is completely honest with me all the time. This girl will tell me when I am wrong and call me on something stupid I have done in a minute. Yet, it is always in good humor and with love. She is that person who will raise my child if something were to happen to me, and I can honestly say that if I were to lay my head down for the final time tonight, I would rest assured that my son was well loved and raised to be the respectful young man I know he is going to be. She has never let me down. I can only hope that she thinks the same of me.  \n",

      "This is one of my own true stories...I still can't believe I did this... I am a red head and was adopted into a family of dark haired, dark eyed, dark skinned, very tall people at 10 days old. When I was about 5 years old, I went through the \"You're not my Mommy/Daddy!\" phase. Well, we were in a shop with our Dad, and he wouldn't get me something I wanted and I started screaming like a wild banshee and proclaiming that he was not my Dad. The manager promptly called security and the police to report a child abduction and we were retained until my mother could bring my birth certificate over to the police station! It is really funny now, but I tink for the very first time, my dear old Dad wanted to spank me just a little bit. And, then it didn't end there! On the way home, my Dad was distracted by but whom, me again (I really wanted that toy) and ran a stop sign and we were pulled over. As we waited for the policeman to bring the ticket back, I continued to plead my case and then decided to make amends. I swear I was trying to be nice when the policeman handed my Dad the ticket and I asked right in front of him if he was \"going to get it fixed!\" Luckily, the policeman just laughed and answered, \"No, he is not!\"  \n",
      "Wow! Congratulations! What a blessing!  \n",
      "I have never been in this situation as a mother, but my adoptive parents had a bio child 6 months after I came to them. We grew up very close. Almost like twins. We were always in the same grades, classes, etc. In my experience, it was and is a wonderful experience. I could not imagine my world without my brother. I consider it a true blessing that I can not remember a time without my dearest friend.  \n",
      "As you continue to think this through, look ahead not to how the artificial twinning will effect you and the birthmothers, but how it will effect the children down the road. I know part of the reason some agencies do not allow this or recommend not doing has to do with developmentally keeping families to a natural birth order type setting, issues of competition, roles, etc.  I have always wondered if any of these experts ever grew up this way...  \n",
      "Oh my goodness. I am so sorry this is happening to your family and in particular, your children. I did not domestically adopt so I am rather unfamiliar with the procedures. To be honest, I can barely make it though most of the abbreviations, but I do understand your points. They are honest, and I really appreciate that.  \n",
      "Shay, Check out One Step Ahead and Leaps and Bounds. Their costumes are great. Madden was a puppy last year at 7 mos. So, yes, you totally have to dress them up. He is going to be a rock star this year. I just can't help it. I love his hair in a cute baby mohawk!  \n",
      "I am sorry. Those pics came out so very poor. It was a first, you know. We have since learned our lesson and carry the dig cam instead of the disposable ones. I think I actually saw a bat costume in one of those catalogs I mentioned before. I like the idea of a witch carrying her little bat. I just can't wait. I am not a holiday person normally, but this kid has brought out the worst in me concerning holidays. I just have to go completely overboard. He is going to wear jeans (I never let him wear jeans) that I studded with silver, a white v-neck t-shirt, little black boots, black sunglasses (he has loved wearing them ever since I started saying \"superstar\" every time he puts them on...don't ask), a few studded embelishments, and sport a blue mohawk. Can you tell I am super excited? I am going to try and go as a clean person. No one will even recognize me!  \n",
      "Boy did we travel the infertility trail. 23 cycles and nothing. I have to say that I do not regret it though. I had to give it a shot or I may have regretted it later. I completely respect other people's decision not to though. Just a word though...you have already had surgery. I am assuming you had a lap since that is what I had due to endo. Why not give it a try and pursue adoption as well? Are fertility procedures covered where you live? They are not in my state and so we could not continue to pay for the procedures and afford the adoption. Just a thought anyway... I hope whatever decision you make it is right for you. I wouldn't worry too much about your mother. She'll come around.  \n",
      "I have to agree with those of you regarding the fact that a 9 month old can be manipulative. Or, you can call it something else if you like. Whatever you call it...these little ones can have you totally pegged! DS would even \"pretend cough\" because he knew it made me come quickly around this age. Oh and the drama...feel free to see my recent post...We have started calling our little angel Laticia because I swear this kid has the sould of an old Southern Baptist woman at a funeral. He just falls out across the floor when he doesn't get what he wants. It is really ridiculous. His whole body turns to spaghetti. There is absolutely no use trying to pick him up because he can somehow slither right from your grasp as if he is covered in vaseline. For the most part, I ignore this behavior. There was a very interesting article about this in Parents magazine this month by the way.  \n",
      "I had to come back and mention that you are also not far from what I am experiencing at this very moment...the stomp-my-feet-I-will-die-if-I-don't-get-it dance. It is ever so beautiful.  \n",
      "DS has had a horrible stomach flu this week. This is one of those things people don't tell you about. It was absolutely aweful. So, when he woke up gagging this am again, I pulled out all the stops and just took the kid to the doctor. 200 bucks later, I find out that he has post-nasal drip and has \"found his gag reflex.\" He is now in his bed where he is supposed to be sleeping saying \"all done\" so I will come and get him. Not gonna happen! This kid hasn't slept the night through since Sunday. And, we made the aweful mistake of putting him in the bed with us. Well, he loves it, but I want to move out about now. He has slept up on me for 3 nights and I am truly exhausted. I have truly gained a new respect for mother's of newborns. DS came home at 6 months and has always slept all night...even though the nights end sometimes a lot earlier that I wish they would. So, I am wondering why dealing with this is not in some kind of book or something... A freind of mine said it perfectly the other day. \"God had to make babies so cute and lovable because you most certainly wouldn't be so pleasant about cleaning poop and puke all day if they were not.\" A little general but a good laugh just the same... Anyway that is the drama here. Anyone else living the life of luxury with a sick baby?  \n",
      "Oh my spay, that is something. I have to say, I did about the same. When I heard the screaming regarding him being covered in vomit, I just popped out of the shower to go get him. It didn't occur to me until Tuesday evening that I had dried shampoo in my hair. LOL  \n",
      "I love the Melissa and Doug line as well. I actually made the mistake just recently of buying ds a bunch of books that have things you can feel in them. What an error in judgement! He now seems to have forgotten about the words that are in the books and cares less about hearing my voice than the cool furs and such. I guess everything is truly a learning experience! Do I have to tell my mother she was right?  \n",
      "DS was originally going to be either Julian, Lucas, or Bryson. Then, we saw him and they didn't fit. So, we named him Madden instead. I like it a lot, though many people don't seem to hear you properly when introducing him or slur it badly. We originally applied for a girl and her name waas to be Adelaide Cecilia. I still love it and want to use either it or Marguerite for a girl when we go back.  \n",
      "Shay, They just happened to find me a 4 1/2 month old little boy instead. At least, that is how old he was when I visited him 1st. He was 6 mos. when he got home. I asked for a girl but was always clear that I was really open to either as gender was not as important as age to me. I wanted at least one to be very young upon arrival. And, that is exactly what they did for me. Thanks for the compliment. Daria is quite a cutie herself. How do you keep your lips off of that girl?  \n",
      "Here are some things I did to pass the time... cleaned out the pantry, cleaned out the laundry room, cleaned out my closet, shopped, shopped and shopped, put old pics in albums, sorted my books and donated some, went though and disgarded linens, cut the grass...(it was so exhausting it helped...though people in the neighborhood gave me some very funny looks) caught up on gardening, tried to read...you won't get to do much of this for a while and it is really hard to do while waiting but I suggest trying...a great book is by Wally Lamb and is titled \"I know this much is true\" moved all breakables from the bottom kitchen cabinets...this will be helpful at baby-proofing time I bet you have done most of this already, but if not, try a few.  \n",
      "Sorry, no advice, but we are in the same boat too. We just consistently watch ds and say \"no touch\" when he goes near it. I think dog food is also a choking hazard. Good luck. How old is Addy?  \n",
      "Ouch! Nine months and getting around that well already! Look out, she is going to be a runner when she gets going on those feet. DS actually has just started running away from me when he has somethinghe knows is a \"no no.\" It is really rather funny. Maybe moving the dog food might help? Is there a room she doesn't frequent? We have 3 dogs and it has been quite the experience. One simply can not stand ds. He is older, semi-blind and arthritic and may be afraid to be hurt. Another wants only his food. And the last just had his major 2nd surgery and is afraid of everything!  \n",

      "Please don't judge me too harshly on this one, but I really need your help. I am trying as of this morning to quit smoking. I quit before leaving for Russia but regrettably failed. I could give you all a host of reasons why, but they are not as important as the fact that I simply didn't do it. And now, I am going for it again. I want this so badly, but I admit, it is so very difficult. Please give me your support. I know that this is best for me and my son. The patch is on...  \n",

I am ripping this patch off, taking a shower (it will be the first time in a long time I go to bed and wake up without smelling like smoke) and then jumping in the bed fast.

My house is super clean, and I have successfully bought more toys that my ds really doesn't need. (but he likes them) Has anyone else used the patch to quit? I have been having to take it off about 7pm and just tough it out. If I leave it on, it continues to act as a stimulant and keeps me up. Thanks again for thinking of me.  \n",

My son is just 16 months now. He came home at six months and has been, of course, the joy of my life. Every minute I can I love to be with him, and I am so grateful to God for this child. But now, I am starting to get that undeniable ache for another child. I so want a daughter. I can't imagine my childhood without my siblings and want that for him as well. I know it is not the appropriate timing for this. We have not yet paid off the infertility much less the adoption! I am just starting back at work this August to pay off the bills more quickly, and we have pretty much agreed that we'll give it a go again when he is about 4. But, I've got the babyitis! Have any of you had to deal with this? And, when we do go try again, I don't know if I actually want to do Russia again. I can't imagine being away from my son that long. Two weeks...twice! I have only about a 4 hour threshold now and then I miss him. I've thought about India and Armenia, but nixed Armenia due to its proximity to both Iran and Iraq. And I don't know anyone with a child from India. I used our last agency because I knew someone with a child from there. We may even be interested in fostering to adopt, but I am so scared of losing a child. What to do???  \n",
      "I completely understand this. I have and do struggle with it constantly. I am trying very hard to just stop doing it. It has no purpose, really. And, it just really makes a person look so bad. I agree with the replacement words. I say poo in place of quite a few words. Not attractive either, but it helps.  \n",
      "I deal with this as well, and to be honest, I just don't push it. I don't want my son to be around people who don't genuinely care for him anyway. And, it would cause way to much inter-household turmoil. It is your husband's family, right? So, maybe, he will say something when it starts to bother him. I know it takes them longer (much longer) to do something like this, but maybe it would be best for you to wait and let Alex enjoy all the people who do love him so much.  \n",

Also, I am a red head myself and was adopted into a family of dark haired, dark eyed, dark skinned, very tall people.

We have a total \"no hit\" rule, but I am so close to popping that bare bottom... (I really am not going to do that, but AHHHHH!!!) I would really appreciate some suggestions. He has shown absolutely no readiness for the potty. And, this is all occurring simply because he is mad that he has to stop what he is doing. It makes no difference to him what toy you give him to hold either, though the toy he is holding may make a difference to you when he hums it at your head! Is this noraml 2 or what?  \n",
      "For me I think it did. Some of it was the extreme hormonal imbalance I was left with after so many cycles. The PCOS and endo were just out of control by the time I stopped behaving like a mad woman. Hormonally I was just a basket case. I spent so very much money and never once achieved pregnancy at all...never once in 23 tries. I am still a little sad about that and I think it has more to do with being an adoptee than anything other than the raging hormones. As an adoptee, I was just so excited when trying to conceive that i would finally have someone who looked like me. As a child I was absolutely plagued with the \"where does she get her {insert whatever physical characteristic here}?\" So, that was important to me for a while. I had to grieve that too. I did make every effort to make certain that before I went on to adopt I had time to grieve the loss of any biological children I might have had. This helped so much. But, I had been killing myself and in such pain (I got horrific sciatica from the progesterone injections) for so long, I was just devastated when it was so hard to love my child and for him to love me for a while...does that make sense? FYI... Everyone says my son looks just like me...hahaha!  \n",

So, I have been reading anything I can get my hands on trying to get ideas about disciplining things like tantrums and throwing and such. Well, I have heard about the Strong-willed Child book so many times, I just thought the iscipline book by that same author would be great. It is Dobson's Dare to Discipline. I am just furiuos that they even allowed something like this to be published!!!!!! Please new parents, stay away from this book! How can anyone endorse this ignorance? The whole thing is about why it is good and necessary to spank your child! AHHHH!!!! I am just furious and am writing a letter to the editor, the author, the publisher and so on! This book recommends nothing short of abuse. Now I don't want to get intot he spanking argument here. This book spoke about how the author's wife hit her 15 month old 3 times with a switch! That is different than a pop on the diaper...which personally I don't agree with but have not ever labeled a tap on the hand or diaper as this type of abuse! Is it ok to get the word out here that this book is unacceptable in my opinion? If not, I am really sorry for violationg TOS and will remove the post...  \n",
      "Thanks so much redhedded. I did just recently find this out. I happen to be a pretty religious Episcopalean, but I was APPALLED. Barnes and Noble let me return the book as well. I was really happy about that as I was upset about contributing to his organization. You know, at one point in this book he talks about how it is ok to squeeze a child's shoulder muscles until his legs buckle. He can tolerate outright cruelty but is not willing to tolerate any other culture or lifestyle. It is an untimate ignorance in my opinion to encourage the things he does and I hope this post keeps at least one person from buying this aweful book. Women and men who are experiencing depression are at such risk for abusive behavior to either themselves or others. There should not be material like this endorsed by anyone of merit sold as potetially helpful for problems with children. I know I am over sensitive about it, but I just can not fathom hitting a child with my hand much less the objects he describes... And thanks for the suggested reading Vicki. We should create a sticky thread of suggested reading somewhere... Does that alreadt exist and I am just out of the loop???  \n",
      "I know from experience this book doesn't help (if not makes things worse when the child is old enough and big enough to hit back and has been taught to do so) and gives permission to the physically abusive to proceed with god's blessings.  Exactly! Thanks.  \n",
      "Janice, I respectfully disagree with you. I am a very conservative Christian and a Republican at that (no comments on this please). I am an extraordinarily old fashioned person who honestly believes in my familiy's traditions and practices form many generations past. I have read the Bible and am, IMO, very close to the Lord. I am going to assume that you are not suggesting anything about me regarding my religious practices as I know and you know that we do not knoow each other and so comments of that sort would be unfounded. So, we just disagree and I am fine with that. Though I would be willing to post this topic anywhere, you'll notice it is in a particular forum. It is here because I do believe that most people have healthy enough relationships with their families to make an appropriate decision about the material in this book when they read it. As you see, most who have responded did so with ideas about this topic that were set before even lookling at the thread. It is a different story though when people are having problems with depressiona dn the like after thier adoptions. You may find youself very alone and though you have reached out for help, you may have been judged too harshly or treated as though you are over reacting. I know I bought several books trying to find answers to my problems after I brought DS home. Some people experiencing PADS and such are at risk for potentially harmful behavior to themselves and others when the condition is at its worst. This may happen in only the very smallest number of cases, but is it not our obligation as fellow adoptive parents, as fellow parents for that matter, to try to help these women as much as possible? I consider keeping them from harmful material that help and I respect that you may disagree. And I have read the book. I refuse to get into the spanking argument with you or anyone else. I was spanked as a child, but I do not spank my own child, in particular not with an object. That opinion will not change after anyone's comments no matter how sensible they may think they are, and i respect that some others feel as though their opinions are just as well founded. I do what is right for my child as do we all. That involves not hitting him with switches no matter the gravity of the situation, not squeezing his neck muscles until he collapses, and not teaching him that the Lord doesn't love those of different lifestyles just as much as He loves the white American married couple with their 2 1/2 well switched kids and their dog... Just my opinion though...  \n",
      "redhedded, You most certainly never offended me. My post was in regard to a later post. I am now well aware of Mr. Dobson's views.

Our pediatrician is the world's fastest shot giver. She can get 3 in before ds even knows what has happened. Have you guys had the talk about why these shots are important? He is really verbal right? I know this won't help at that moment, but it will help him after. I think it is ok to let kids know they are getting these shots because they can get really sick without them.

We started this one day because I wore my hair down and ds was terrified. It oddurred to me that since we have been away from home, I have not had time to fix my hair and wear it down once. The poor kid hadn't seen me like that in so long it scared him. So, I gave him a brush and let him play with it and brushed his own myself. He even tried to get a clip in it. Anyway, then we found out he likes me to tickle him with it. He gives great eye contact waiting to find out where I am going to get him. Anyway, it is a fun game and has helped. Mike...I am still working on one for you... I am assuming you can't play this one. lol  \n",
      "I've been gone for a few days on sanity leave... Basically, I really have needed a vacation from my life. I got an overnight without baby, and that helped a lot. But I have to admit I am down. I know this is not PADS related at all. I am just very overwhelmed. I didn't want to mention it here at first because I don't want people to think I am a big whiner, but after a long discussion with a forum friend the other night, I am convinced that you all will understand. Please do not take that comment persinally as it is more about me than any of you. My self esteem is in the garbage right now. It is so me. Anyway, here is what has happened... Our house, the one that had 8 feet of water in it, was looted. We didn't have a whole lot left in it. But we do have a small second floor area where the roof is in good condition and we had a few thigs that we simply could not move or fity into storage there. Well, both thaat area and the storage shed were broken into and there is pretty much nothing there now. The stuff being gone is ok, really. And I have resigned myself to this life so much that I wasn't even completely livid about the break in. What got me was the way the police treated me when I called to report it. They basically treated me like I was lying about it! Locks and deadbolts were crow barred off on both the house and shed! No, I am not living there! But I do go to check on MY HOME every day of the week! I had to wait for almost 4 hours for this stupid cop to even get there and then when he did he was so unprofessional it was ridiculous! He kept calling me \"babydoll!\" I HATE THAT!!!!!!! Like that is going to make me feel better about my house being intruded upon! I am down anyway. I am trying to continue to care at all. And I do. I am just so disgusted and do not want to have a bad attitude or be negative aroud those of my friends here who are going through such difficult times. Is that stupid of me? But now I feel so guilty for only thinking of me these last few days. I am never like this. I just don't know how to keep getting up from things like this. And then, and it may seem stupid, but our contractor just told me he is about 6 weeks behind for us... That now means that we may be home at the beginning of May... I just want to cry non-stop! I hate to burden anyone with this, but we sure could use some prayers now...  \n",
      "Thanks so much everyone... I did speak to his supervisor today and got quite the apology. We may be able to get a... dum, dum, dum....... FEMA trailer soon. That will help. We can be away form here and be closer to our house. Thanks so much again.  \n",

I need some real, exact methods and strategies here... And Jeannette...I HAVE to know where you got the ultra-cool mommy rock star shirt... A friend of mine thinks it is really funny and sent ds a shirt that says \"lock up your daughters.\" I didn't quite appreciate the humor in it and disposed of it.

      "Ugh! Don't you just hate when you go somewhere for that very particular thing for your kid and they are out. I am glad your wife was able to find it though. I am going to have to find out more about this commando parenting thing... DS is driving me absolutely nuts.  \n",
      "My new auto response to every stupid comment has become, \"Oooo, I'm sorry. I had no idea you were so uninformed. You should read more.\" I know it is mean, but I am pre-menstrual, what can I say? Sorry to the men here for that TMI...  \n",
      "So, I need to go ahead and confess here. Most of you know my attachment and PADS woes. But, I have also seemingly replaced most of my depression problems with quite abit of anxiety. It is weird. For example, before ds was 12 mos and was communicating a great deal, my major mom worry was autism. I know this comes from the fact that I have a nephew with sever PDD and have watched him struggle so much....I am saying that knowing both ds and I are adopted so genetically we could not be at risk...even if that matters??? Well, then he starts signing a lot and other stuff, he basically is in no way pdd. So ok, then my new anxiety becomes shaken baby syndrome. If we play too much or too rough will I have shaken him up too much and hurt him. Duh...I have never shaken him or been rough. Playing wildly for a few minutes won't hurt him, but I get worried. It is almost like he turns to glass all of a sudden. I get afraid of him being hurt by anything. This all really started when we started attachment parenting. So, was my attachment unhealthy? Am I making him co-dependent? And then, am I again worrying too much over this? I am so used to people telling me I over-react. But, I feel like I have to ask and ask again because someone didn't catch it when I asked once and it hurt me and my son. I am just worrying, worrying and worrying lately. Is he happy enough? Is he learning enough? Does he feel safe? Has he eaten enough? Did he need me when I wasn't there? Am I hovering? So, really, I know I am a freak here. I just have no idea lately. At the park the other day I mentioned to an aquaintance that i have no idea how to teach ds about the dangers of just walking off things that are too high up. She said, \"you just have to let them fall.\" But, I can't let him fall. i just can't. My goodness, he falls enough when I am watching. Is this how you teach them to be careful so you don't have to worry so much? I see other kids who are more adept at play and aware of danger... so, this makes me worry that he is developmentally delayed... see where I am going with this... I did mention that i am a freak??? lol  \n",
      "My other really neurotic fear is this. She's pretty heavy for me at 32 pounds and already more than 1/2 my height. Carrying her up and down the stairs (I only do this mornings, bedtimes, or when she's up in the middle of the night) is a challenge. Sometimes I stand at the top of the stairs and say to myself, \"what if I fall?\" This is so like me. I have thought that very thing so many times. Holding to try and improve attachment is so tough. Just today we went to a parade and he insisted I hold his big 31 pounds the whole hour and a half. I am so going to pay for that tomorrow, but I loved every minute of it today...  \n",
      "What if they DONT miss me? (they are NOT allowed to grow up, dont they know that!!!) This is too funny. I say this all the time to my best friend's kids. I'll tell them they are in big trouble. They know the routine so they say, \"Oh no, what for?\" And I say, \"No one gave you permission to grow up!\" Then they reply, \"We forgot but we promise to stall small from now on.\" And then I tell them that I am very sorry but they still must face the consequences of their actions and they are to be immediately punished by the kiss attack. And then I basically kiss them until they can't stand it anymore... I can't imagine not being as worried about a second child, but I am going to take your word for that. I am hoping for another one day... we'll see. Hope your boys have a great sleepover. I totally get your worries there as well. So, just to clarify... ok, I mentioned that we go to the park every day. I feel like I give him enough freedom not to lose my mind, but I am really very interested in getting him to become aware / afraid of dangerous things / situations. Your advice is to let him fall a little bit??? I try to get a sense of when to intervene and let him sense the danger himself first... Any other suggestions? Also, I have been very proud of myself this week., He has had a cold and has been eating like a bird. I have not freaked about it as I know he will not die without food, though I did give his bottle back to him. Also, he is just 22 months old. Is some of this clumsy, unaware of danger behavior normal for his age?  \n",
      "Oh thank you so much, and crick and shoshana...I am so glad she has come out of hiding to help me a bit...ok, actually a lot. I have to admit that once I thought about it I have to kind of agree that perhaps part of my worry has to do with the fact that I do not want people to know I mess up too much. Some of my family is so very judgemental...they make me so nervous that it seems as though I mess up more when they are around. I probably look completely incompetent because they fry my nerves. This will get better when we are home again, but for now, I am admittedly a nervous wreck most of the time. This is all such a \"tedious balance,\" kretz. And, as a new mom, you ask sometimes and the answers seem way out of line to me. I seriuosly had someone tell me to let my child fall off that platform so he would learn not to do it again. Maybe some people would consider it, but I simply could not. The thought of him getting hurt seriously makes my heart want to stop. Thanks again for all your advice. How did the sleepover go Jen?  \n",
      "Oh no! Ok so, I posted over on the original threadbut still...that is phenomenal and you are just amazing for providing that type of support to someone so desperately in need. I couldn't agree more with what you said about at least helping to provide the possibility of things working out. Also, I think 8 - 10 ounces a day is really too little... Am I wrong? I am glad SS is involved wso that this child and family can get the support they need. I have friends who adopted 2 Cree children. They are beautiful and their nation family supports them and helps their new family learn about their culture and integrate it into their lifestyle. They have all learned so very much from the elders. More importantly... GO JEN! :cheer: GO JEN! :cheer: GO JEN! :cheer: On a different note...after all my worrying ds now has 102 fever and pink eye again and got his first haircut today! What trauma! I am gonna post his new haircut pic on the Russia board and put the link in here if I can figure it out.  \n",

I refuse to believe that my child will ever be seriously injured and that if that ever occurred I would not collapse and die of a massive thrombosis... I can not wait to have more to lighten this load a bit... I just have to be very careful, as the anxiety is mine, that he never carries that load... I will do anything not to share my anxieties with him...  \n",
      "I agree that speaking to your doctor is imperative. It never hurts to ask and you should never be ashamed to ask anyone. I definately learned this the hard way. It is normal to be over tired during this time, even if your baby is sleeping well. That sleep deprivation and overall stress can lead to simple crankiness or can actually contribute to depression.

      "What a stinker of a teacher. I know you have posted b/f about this, but remind me please, did you and the teacher ever discuss a behavior modification plan? Does he go to school all day? Do most disruptions happen in the afternoon? Is he napping at school? I agree that if he doesn't have to be with this class and teacher it would probably be most helpful, but I also believe, JMHO, that this could work...  \n",

I am just now learning to \"save\" some of the joys from the good days to get me through the bad and other stress relief techniques. PADS, IMHO, doesn't always necessarily go away.

      "I hope this doesn't worry you to hear this as I am just telling you my experience. But, most often teachers really start identifying children who are not up to par after Christmas time. This is most often done to give parents appropraite warning of impending retention. This warning usually serves 2 purposes. It provides adequate feedback to the arent and it, hopefully, leads to all parties revisiting those skills lacking and making every effort to attain mastery. For a good teacher, and she sounds like one, it is a way to let the parent know that all parties, parent, teacher and child (and any appropriate services) must regroup and come together to focus on the skills required to move to the next grade. I am not in any way saying this is what was happening. It is just a normal occurrance in schools, IMO. Sitting still and being able to focus on tasks are necessary skills that must be mastered or very close to it before entering first grade. I would look at this as an opportunity to come together with the teacher and help Julia attain these skills. The teacher sounds more than willing to help your child.  \n",
      "being bad. Now, let me back up a minute. DS has not really slept uniterrupted or eaten much in about a week. Well, since we were at the doctor 2 weeks ago for fluid in his ears, I just figured he had an ear infection again. Actually, I was pretty much expecting to hear that my kid was deaf now, since he comepletely ignores my requests and / or commands now. So, when he said nothing is wrong with him, I like to choked. I am like, \"Do you see this kid? (picture boy child sprawled across the floor throwing such a loud, screaming tantrum that the office staff have come to see who has been injected with a 12 foot needle...) How can nothing be wrong with him? Something better be wrong with him. I haven't slept in 7 days and am astronomically tired of being ignored, screamed at, and the like. And by the way, could you check to make sure he does not have a bone disease because I swear sometimes the kid falls apart like his bones are jello (like when I try to bring him somewhere else or pick him up) and other times (like when I put him onto my lap) the child's bones all meld together and he becomes a tree like figure that absolutely can not bend! Really right? Something HAS to be wrong!\" So, he laughed and diagnosed my kid with \"bad.\" I have to agree but I was just hoping that this was something that there was medication for! He is soooooo having a nice dose of Benadryl tonight anyway! MOMMY IS TIRED!!!!!!!!  \n",
      "You all are soooo funny! We did get some of that wonderful codeine filled cough syrup last night. He actually slept the whole night through! He does have a cold so it was necessary, so I felt justified and all. I am going to ask about the Melatonin. Normally he is a good sleeper, once he is actually asleep. I just can't figure out what is with him lately. I think a lot of it is that he has been missing sleep so he is tired and literally running from it! Discipline has become a mojor concern. As most of you know, I simply do not agree with viollence and I view pretty much all spanking as violent. But man! That bottom is looking very popable right about now. LOL. I just can't ever hit him and won't and he knows it. He absolutely has no fear and could care less about time outs. Time ins become an absolute screaming match. So, i just do not know what else to do with him. He will walk away from me wherever we are to see something interesting and refuse to turn around when I call him. He would truly just go about his business if I didn't follow and then scream when he got over whatever it was he was interested in and noticed I didn't follow... And Mike...I am going to pioneer a study for the antibiotic that cures \"bad\" and invent a \"chip\" that you hook up to your GPS to put in our kids. A friend of mine thinks this chip should be able to administer just a little shock when the are 15 or so and you turn on the GPS only to find out they are not at Grandma's house but at a bar instead!!! I had to say I thought that was a bit overboard as it is much more appropriate for Mom or Dad to simply show up at the bar in bluejean overalls and a turban shrieking \"My baby! Come to Mama!\"  \n",

I always pray first for other people, then I pray for things I would like to see those people have or do or achieve, and then I pray for me. Most often I fall asleep well before I get to me and I always know that that peace is God's greatest blessing and all I really \"needed\" anyway. I hope it may help someone...  \n",

I have also told Karen that if I had a bit of extra money ever I would love to buy a case of Deborah Gray's book and give it to the sw who did my homestudy and ask her to give one to every couple who came in there.

      "Hi Karen, My son was 6 months old when I brought him home, and I just want to say that I didn't really get on board with attachment parenting until quite a while after and that decision hurt us both. Now that I use some attachment parenting techniques, modify others to best suit me, and refuuse some we have come a long way. I guess my point is that it doesn't hurt to try what you feel comfortable doing. And if you are not confortable with something, that is ok too. JMHO, I think she may be crying because she needs you right now. She might not know what she needs IS YOU may be the problem. Do you know how it is when you are not really hungry but want something? I think she may be anxiuos over the fact that she needs to feel safe and secure and attached and is simply unsure where to get her needs met. It is very common for kids to actually puch away those that are there to meet their needs. You just have to keep coming back and keep responding to that cry no matter how many times and no matter how difficult. It is sad but you have to remember that she has probably cried in the past and not had her needs met and so she is trained to feel that \"want\" no matter what. You just have to keep being the answer no matter what. There are successes that come in such small doses at first and then full fledged later. My son, who is 22 months old, has JUST started actually wanting me to hold him. Finally he holds his arms up to me because he wants me after months of batting at me, pushing away from me, and me holding him as much as I found appropriate and as much as I felt did not hinder his natural sense of curiousity. And, we do practice a modified version of holding time. We started at bedtime. I would sit him on my lap facing me and we would rock and play and sing and touch each other. This is so helpful in promoting eye contact. Then when he gets tired enough to be ok with it, I shift him into the cradle position. I trace his lips and nose and eyes and hairline with my fingers and rub his hands and feet a lot. You'll see remarkable improvements after doing this a while, I promise. And, I do agree that personality has a lot to do with things. My son is simply very strong willed sometimes, but I will admit that for months I mistook his attachments problems with just personality. Not every problem like this is an attachment problem and the line between attachment and personality can blur at times. But with a PI child, JMHO, but isn't it better to err on the side of caution? Anyway, I am sorry to ramble on. Your story sounds so like mine in some regards. It pains me so that I waited so long to help my child out of mere ignorance. I would be more than happy to help you anytime. It sounds like your baby girl needs you something aweful right now. There is no discipline for that... just love... over and over again until that baby whose needs were not met knows that her Mama is going to meet them EVERY time she calls for you. When that happens, she'll caall you less because she'll know you are there...  \n",
      "I am so glad that you experiences like this turned out well. It is so much healthier for both the parent and child. Here is my experience... This was most prevalent during our evacuation when we had to stay with family and I HAD to leave him with family members for short spurts. They would let him get away with murder! He watched videos ALL DAY and ate only JUNK! They even gave him SODA!!!!!!! I was furious. And then, their were the comments about how I am raising him... I need to cut his hair, I let him get dirty too much (HE IS A LITTLE BOY!), I let him get wet to much (No death certificate has ever listed \"got wet\" as a cause of death!), I let him \"catch a chill after a bath (How exactly does one streaking, giggling, naked child look frozen to some and very happy to others???), and the list could go on. And as for time outs... well that is most certainly not right. They think a swat on the butt cures everything! Now, why would you make me have to tell you that I'll kill you??? And, can you give him his bottle? No. Why not? Because. Because why? Because I am his MOTHER AND I SAID NO! Then lets critique what I feed him and how. Lord knows that EVERY older woman thinks a mother doesn't feed her children enough. My child is 22 months and 30 pounds. I am perfectly well aware that I am starving him. This wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that you gave him like 20 pringles 30 minutes ago! OK...stepping off soapbox and laughing...  \n",

Stopping smoking will definately help with that. January resolution down... Here comes May!  \n",
      "Hopefully May!!! And AnimalCrackers...try Smoothie milkshakes. They have like 2000 calories. Also, lots of caffeine free soda, bread, rice or potatoes with everything, and eat ALL the time! That is all I can suggest for now. I have never really been able to keep my weight up well either. People laugh, but it is a big problem and leads to a lot of illnesses. I also suggest laying off multivitamins as they ALWAYS curb my appetite. Juice helps too. I'll let you know what works as I find out. Good luck to everyone!  \n",

We are ALL SYSTEMS GO FOR JUNE! :clap: My endo looks only minimal after the last lap and I am having bllodwork done later this month. A US on cd3 and more labs and then bcp until May and then we are off! Please God let this work! I am so glad you all will be here for this!  \n",

      "Just FYI... if this was the case, then every time you let your little one wear cool, princess or action hero underwear, you are inviting sexual harassment. But, do we believe that it is sexual hasarrment for a child to want to show her friend her Beauty and the Beast underwear? And, if another child misses seeing it and pulls her waistband to get a look at what she has shown, is that an attack? Doesn't some of this border on ridiculous? I can not believe any child has ever been scarred by something so innocent. Aren't we as adults projecting our fears onto the innocent acts of children. They have no shame and no sexual behaviors. Isn't that the beauty of being children? Now, as for the 5th grade child who was kicked. That was a physical attack and even if done in ignorance of the implications, was serious enough to warrant suspension, IMHO. I applaude you for going to that parent!  \n",
      "I am most certainly not saying it should not be addressed. I do not agree that it is always \"meant\" to be inappropriate even though it should be addressed that it is for future occasions. But, is it \"harassment?\" I simply do not think so and would not believe that is was, though I agree that warning children that the behavior is not acceptable is ok, to turn it into something like harassment scars both children involved. \n",

      "We also wanted open adoption. Only you know why you want open adoption and then tell the birth mother why. I think it would reassure her that you really want to have the bmom in the babies life. I'll tell you why we wanted open adoption. I didn't want our son to wonder for most of his life who is his bparents or who do he looks like and where he comes from. That is the main reason we wanted open adoption. I must admit I was a little scared of having her over. I thought maybe she will try and be the mommy of the baby but she fell into the role of our daughter. I am glad to say our open adoption is going very, very well. What I would tell you is make sure you talk with your bmom and talk out how you both want the relationship to work out. Also talk about what the baby will call the birth mother. Good luck  \n",
      "When we adopted our first son I was 41 and my second son at 48. My sons are now 7 years old and 16 months. I still have the energy to care for them.;) I say if you really want to adopt after 40....go for it. You know yourself best. Madelyn  \n",

      "Darlene, We adopted domestically. Our first adoption was thought Catholic Social Ministires. Even though they were so wonderful I don't think they are doing adoptions anymore. The cost was about 3,000 dollars but the wait was 5 years. Now, that was in 1990. A lot has change in adoption since than. Now our second son I did a web pages and put it in the internet. Our son's birth mother found us and she did admit she would of liked us younger. But she like us and placed her baby with us. The cost was under 5000 dollars. If you go this route let me know and I'll give you some good advise. We couldn't afford to go international, otherwise we would of done it. This is good if you want a specific gender. If you have the money for international I would go for it. If you like to talk more you can email me at mholmes899@aol.com Good luck. Madelyn P.S. My friend adopted from China two time. She is single.:) \n",

Race - I just wrote no on the Ethnicity -Hispanic? spot but am unsure of what the \"correct\" term is to put under race? Do I write AA or black? I know that sounds completely silly but I've never had to write anything in on a form before, normally there are boxes to check. AS is really multiracial but his biological parents just called him black. Biodad is black/AA but biomom is a mixture of white/black/puerto rican & some american indian thrown in as well.  \n",

My 2yr old has beautiful curls =nowhere near as tight as his brother but they only look good for maybe an hour after I do his hair and then it starts getting fuzzy & dry looking :( Everyone is talking about putting olive oil in the bath??

      "Am I reading this right? Just the sickle cell trait but not the actual disease? So like a carrier? Would that be something that would be shared with us in medical files? I know my son is a carrier of Thalessemia but only because he failed his initial newborn screening and had to have follow up testing to make sure he didn't actually have thalessemia. Just wondering if sickle cell trait would be kinda like that- they'd fail a test and then find out they were only a carrier?  \n",
      "We adopted our daughter from foster care in our state, her mother then went to another state where her other daughter was taken into care. Although the 2nd state wasn't told anything about us or our daughter at all- when we found out I immediately started calling the DCS office and hounding them. They were thrilled to be able to have the sisters adopted into the same home. It all depends on the state.. My own state made a point to keep our daughters' brothers away from us and they knew from the start that they were related. Good luck! I would call and try my hardest!!  \n",

      "I am not sure what I'd do with your FS. I do agree that you should take your other kids though :) It's a wonderful experience. When we adopted our AD, we had to travel to TX to finalize. We took the whole family including our two FSs that we were planning to adopt. My oldest FS had a lot of emotional issues with it but more of the fact that he has been with me his entire life (almost 5yrs) and she had been with us not even a year== yet she was getting adopted & he had to wait. We have since been able to finalize his adoption but it did cause him some trama. I honestly don't think being there or not is the issue. He would have been just as tramatized had we not taken him to the actual event b/c AD talked to everyone about her adoption ect.. I guess I'm not much help! LOL Good luck :)  \n",

      "I agree with OakShannon.. Biology isn't the most important, obviously, but it is important. In our case, we've adopted from foster care 4 times now. We have two seperate sets of biological siblings that were NOT placed at the same time. Our ***(4 &2) are full brothers and both came to us as newborns- 2yrs apart. We were done prior to AS2 because of the medical issues and needs of AS4 but when we found out Bmom was pregnant, we knew we'd take the baby. Our ADs (7&6) are also full siblings. We had AD6 from birth and adopted when she was 1.5yrs. AD7 we didn't get until she was 5.5 and then from another state.. She was everything we always said we'd never take- older than our youngest, sexual abuse, ect but she was our AD's full sibling and how could we not give them the chance to grow up together? They share a common history & we always felt that while these kids lose so much, at least they can have a small part of their past.  \n",

I stayed there a few years back and while it's a non-smoking resort now it wasn't always and we had A LOT of issues trying to get a room that didn't reek of smoke (bad for our 3 asthmatics!) The best advice I'd give is DON\"T buy from the resort!! Go look at Ebay or ask around.. My parents actually have a week for sale.. lol. The good thing also is that you don't always have to go to your home resort- you can exchange it for anywhere. I rarely use my vegas one & just exchange it for other places..  \n",

      "Ours was the same. We have adopted 4 times. Our first one we had since birth & her old medical records stayed under her name but they marked the file w/ the new name & \"formerly known as\" and then began using the new name from there on out. Our 2nd one was placed here from out of state as an adoptive placement. When she arrived my state went ahead and issued the medicaid in her new name (no clue how they did that.. lol) so all her medical records started in the new name & they just copied what we had from her & put into her file.Our 3&4th adoptions we're still dealing with. Our dr has put a sticky on the file so they call the kids by their new names but they are still under the old names because medicaid hasn't changed over yet. I am curious why your daughter isn't being added until Feb? We didn't add our 2 newest sons only because it was a hassle to mess with since our insurance was changing on Jan 1, so we just used medicaid alone as it hasnt' changed to their new names yet anyway.. HOWEVER, adoption is just like giving birth. If you currently have insurance, you don't have to wait for an enrollement period. Your child is eligible for your insurance the day you adopt.  \n",
      "Good luck!!  \n",
      "Welcome!! I agree, this is a wonderful place to find out more about adoption. If you need a resource for surrogacy, PM me and I can give you some support boards for that :) I have been a surrogate myself and am also a foster & adoptive mom so I guess I'm well rounded in what you're looking at.. lol. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to help you in any way I can! Good luck in your journey! Only you can choose which path is right for you, they are all great options!  \n",

My sons have mulitple health issues, while my daughters are overall healthy.DD#1- we had from birth, mom was higher than a kite on Meth when born. DD tested ++ in urine & meconium.. She did participate in First Steps for her first 3years but was not significantly behind. She is 100% completely healthy in fact her only issue is consitpation. She is very well attached and a complete doll- everyone loves her.DD #2- was in the care of her birthmom living in various drug houses, neglected and abused for the first 3yrs of her life. She was not tested @ birth but considering she is the full sibling to DD#1 & only 12mo older we also know she was exposed to Meth. She is healthy as well. She does have some ADHD & anxiety disorder which she is on meds for. She is doing very well but we've only had her for a year so I can't comment on her first 5yrs of life.  \n",

No one wanted to go but everyone had fun..

      "Surrogacy in itself is not bad and evil. I hate that the only newstories are the bad ones that scare people away & make them think all surrogates are baby/money hungry people. In this case- quite honestly I can see the surrogates side. I do not agree with what she did but it would be quite a shock to find these things out in court. She should have done better research, that's her fault. But as a surrogate, carrying a baby for 9months regardless of the genetics - you feel a certain responsiblity toward them (paid or not). Yes she was 'paid' to do a job but I'm thinking in her eyes she has the only connection- having carried the baby since there are no genetic connection. I would never be a surrogate for someone that was using both an egg & sperm donor. That on top of being in Michigan is what caused this problem to begin with. To me, surrogacy is about helping create a family and it's a wonderful experience .. However, I do it because the mother can't carry- it's still their genetics. Obviously I dont know the entire story of why they went with a surrogate but egg donor, sperm donor & surrogate-- seems like a custom order baby to me. Asf or the gay couple-- who would ever imagine that your own sister would turn on you? SCREENING people! Both things could have been avoided with screening- it would have brought forth the Potential Mother's mental health issue & she could have matched with a surrogate who was ok with that.. It also would have been discussed the fact that the gay men's sister has never had her own child- very few drs will accept a surrogate who has never delivered their own child. Shutting up as this has become a book.. Sorry, I love surrogacy and hate seeing it painted badly by the bad press- why do we never see the good stories/  \n",
      "I do think that in this case because of the laws of MI and lack of genetic connection to the potential parents- this is basically an arranged adoption. The laws really differ depending on the state. For example in Indiana, the potential parents (called Intended Parents in the surrogacy world) can be put directly on the birth certificate w/a pre-birth order as long as they are genetically related.. If only one parent is related and the other is a donor sperm or egg, then the one parent can be put on the birth certificate & the other must do a step parent adoption.. Although it's a very simple procedure to get the pre-birth order, the steps must be taken because without it, the surrogate will go on the birth certificate as the mother & her husband will go on as father. Some states are even more lenient.. Illinois, for example, is VERY surrogacy friendly. Surrogacy contracts are enforceable and you can get a pre-birth order even if not genetically related (like using a traditional surrogate - who uses her own eggs). As a surrogate, I definitely believe in the theory.. But I also believe that lots of work needs to be put into it.. Both sides need to be thoroughly screened and need to match with someone who agrees completely with the other.. Surrogacy is a wonderful thing but it does not fit into every situation.  \n",
      "We are out of everything here. While we planned on only getting the seasonal Flu -our drs office ran out the day prior to our appts! ugh!

      "I agree with a PP.. It's the drug charges that ruin it for me. The bioparents of my kiddos are all addicts (foster adoption) and I will not give them my home address. They have only my cell number and do not know the name of my town. I do have a PO box (located in a nearby city) that I use only for them. I think it's a very personal decision. Good luck!  \n",

      "I think this situation is so very different and more complex than a surrogacy arrangement. This woman was planning/hoping/praying on carrying her own baby yet by this awful mistake of the clinic (how in the world it happened w/all the protocols involved is beyond me!!) she is being forced into this sitation.As a surrogate- you go into this knowing you are doing a wonderful thing for a couple that needs help. I can definitely see why this woman did not want to terminate but I cannot imagine how difficult this will be on her knowing that if this mix up hadn't occurred she might be carryign her own baby. To make things worse- the fact that she cannot carry another pregnancy after this one so has lost her last chance of carrying another child (that she can keep) just seems to be like salt in the wound. Now she will be forced to use a surrogate for her remaining embryos.I definitely empathize with her and if I were in her shoes I would do the exact same thing but it would tear my heart out. It's quite one thing to be a surrogate b/c you wanted and a completely different to be thrust into the situation like this.  \n",
      "[QUOTE=Lupin]I too think about it being a bit of a \"Womb for Rent\" I've contemplated doing this myself for my best friend, & this is what/how we describe it I would do it for Altruistic means, but I would not expect to get paid for anything, unless they were able to replace the cost of my time spent off work, aka pay me what exactly what I would be getting if I was working. However the thought of making double my Yearly pay(the 20-25K you mention) is making me contemplate doing it for not so altruistic reasons. Hell that's nearly as much as my Husband makes a year in his Apprentice Trade job! So as for \"Measly wages\" umm that's not that bad, & would be a decent down payment on a house, would also be paying off my Student loans(from 4 years of University) or pay for another few years of schooling so I can get my Degree. If we are going to discuss the compensation let's think about this realistically. If 20-25K (the average 1st timer gets more like (18-20k)is double your yearly pay- how many hours do you work? The pregnancy is 10months long x 30days per month x 24hrs a day which in most cases roughly equals a bit over $2/hr. No vacations , no days off, the possibility of bedrest. the wear & tear on your body. Not to mention the weeks of injections that you are putting into your own body prior to the pregnancy. How many attempts may be tried to even get pg. The time you spend with testing and so forth before starting the process. Not to mention the risk of the pregnancy & birth b/c yes women do still die from childbirth- it may not happen as often but freak things happen all the time! I could go on but I won't. Yes I am/was a surrogate and yes I did get compensation so perhaps that colors my thoughts on the matter. But quite honestly it is a very big undertaking and working at McD's I could have made the $15k quicker. There are surrogates who may do this for the money but they are very few. For most it is a way to help someone in a very special way and the money is a perk.  \n",

My 1yo also has feeding issues and was dx FTT. He's doing very well and finally started gaining weight once the dr put him on pediasure. He was like your little one- drank bottles ok (about 14-22oz day) but didn't eat.

      "My father had open heart surgery about 4yrs ago. He had bypass & then they replaced his mitral valve. We were not told of the possible complication but he ended up having to have a pacemaker implanted b/c his heart just did not beat right after the surgery. We were told it was a possible side effect of the valve replacement & sometimes the heart just doesn't beat right afterwards.. Did they leave a temporary pacemaker in place?

      "I can help you a tad.. Personally I wouldn't go with a Roundabout just b/c it has the smallest weight limit. It looks like your little one is just 4mo? So you're looking for a convertible for after the infant seat? If so your options are the Roundabout, Marathon, Decathalon, & Boulevard . The Frontier is more of a booster seat w/ 5pt harness & doesn't start til 2yo & 25lbs.. Ihave both the marathon & the decathalon seats.. They have the same weight limits ect (I do love that Britax supports extended rear facing with their weight limits!) but the Decathalon has some extra padding .. If buying for an infant, I'd choose the Decathalon .. Good luck :)  \n",

I know if the BPs of my daughter ever wanted to place again, I'd love to take that child as well..

Most of the time in an independent arrangement , the lawyer isn't brought in til closer to the end. Good luck!!  \n",

      "[FONT=\"Georgia\"]Hi all! You may recall that we got our 5yr old adoptive placement this summer. There was very little transition- we spent a week in TX and she went to the hotel with us the first day and stayed the entire week. At that time I was disappointed w/ the FM bc she had all her stuf packed and wanted us to take it immediately- she seemed very withdrawn already and that she wanted to be done with the child. *L* did not want to go back to the foster home at all and wanted to come home with us but did end up going back for a long weekend before being flown out to be placed in our home. We'd definitely had our share of behaviors but overall things have been going well. *L* does not ask or talk about her old foster mom (who she lived with for 2yrs -FM did not want to adopt). Initially we were all for keeping a relationship with the previous FM b/c she did have *L* for a large portion of her young life. After meeting, we assumed FM would not want contact as she appeared very distanced. She has called twice to check on *L* and talk to her so perhaps she was just trying to protect herself by withdrawing. My problem & the reason I'm coming to you is this : *L* does not mention or ask about her previous FM except after a phone call. The calls are not always appropriate- for example the first one a teen previous foster sibling was talking to*L* and kept asking her \"Dont you miss us??\" which then leads to days of *L* being upset that her old family is mad at her b/c they miss her and they're mad she left them. During last nite's phone call (2nd to date) FM told *L* that maybe they'd come visit her some day. *L* mentioned that we lived very very far away but FM said they'd come on a plane or bus ect.. She later told me that she has thought of coming to visit us but not for several years. *L* is under the impression that they are going to come visit us soon and take her back home with them (since we came to visit her & she came to live w/us shortly after). She has made comments that she's just visiting us while she goes to school but when school is over she has to go back to her old house. I guess my problem is that I dont feel the old foster family is being age appropriate w/ her at this time. I dont nececssarily want to cut off all contact but thought perhaps I should stop phone calls until after *L* is more adjusted , has started therapy and really understands that she is here to stay. I dont like seeing her upset and confused and of course this adds to her tantrums and behavior issues.Am I wrong to think we should stop the contact until at very least the adoption is finalized & she understands better that this is her new permanent home? Advice would be appreciated! [/FONT]  \n",
      "We are heading to TX to meet our new daughter next week! A bit of a unique situation which gets more tongue tied when I try to explain but I\"ll give it a go : We started foster care 5yrs ago. Our first placement was our now AD who was placed at birth.. When AD was born, she had a full sister *L* who was 12months older yet DCS did not take her b/c she was not technically in BM's care at the time. So we have known about AD's older sister from the beginning.. There were a few reports that were investigated but nothing ever happened and they all moved around. BM ended up in TX w/ *L* and eventually *L* went into foster care. We found out about it and let them know our interest.. So now after a year of waiting, TPR has happened, appeal time is over, we've been thru ICPC & are FINALLY getting ready to meet her. We've sent a few photo books of our family & home ect. We have yet to even see a pic of *L* but are told she looks very much like our AD. We are actually still waiting on the casefile to look over but it should be very soon. It is actually quite possible that we will meet her prior to getting the casefile. So we are planning to head down and get to meet her next week. We are staying 9days there and right now the plan is for the AW to place her in our home 2 days after we get back. Not to much of a transition but since we are well over 1000 miles away it's whats going to happen.. L is 5. She has been told about the adoption and understands whats going on.. OMG that was long.. lol! My question- yes there really is one- is how in the world do we introduce ourselves to her?? In our photo books I put them all from our AD's point of view so referred to ourselves as her mommy & daddy.. I've never done this before and never even fostered one this old- we tend to stick to the newborns. Any advice would be appreciated :) Sorry for the book! LOL!  \n",
      "MileHighDad-- Thank you sooo much for your advice and tips :) I really do appreciate it :)  \n",
      "Well we are here! Things definitely went differently than expected. We went to her fosterhome at 9am Friday to meet her w/ the fostermom & adoption worker.. We left at 10:30am with *L* with us! She's been with us every since and does not want to go back to her foster home. The first nite she was a little sad and said she missed her \"old mom\" but when we offered several times to take her back home to sleep and come get her the next day she refused. She wants to stay with us.> We went back to the foster home the next day and she was very concerned that we might leave her so made sure to keep us in her eyesight at all times , then had us pack up all her stuff in the van.. loL! Poor kiddo! Right now the plan is for us to be here til Saturday morning when we're heading back home, and the AW will fly her to our house next week. She is adament that she is staying with us and not going to her foster home ever again.. Not sure how well that is going to work but the AW is going to try to see if she can get special permission for *L* to just ride home with us.. She doesn't want her to get all upset when we leave.. Like I said, definitely not what we expected but great! We'd planned on meeting her Friday w/ everyone around. Going back the next day and taking her out for a bit- gradually building up our time together.. lol ! I guess you know what they say about the best laid plans right? loL! Thank goodness everyone is getting along great and no problems so far :)  \n",
      "THanks! Unfortunately I heard from the AW today and she can't get permission for *L* to ride home with us. So we will be dropping her back at her fosterhome on Friday sometime and she'll be flying to our house next week. I have no clue how this is going to go since she is very strongly against even going back to the foster home to visit w/o us.. If anyone has any advice on how to explain this to a 5yo so it's not quite so tramatizing, I'd appreciate it!! Her aw is having an emergency and wont be available to be there when we drop her back off & also wont be able to be the one to fly her to us.. Only a week before we're all back home safe and sound!  \n",
      "Things went well! Thanks for asking! Although *L* was very against us dropping her back at the foster home (cried every nite about it) on Friday morning she woke up in a good mood and had no problem going back. We just kept reminding her that FM was throwing a good bye party and she'd get to see her friends ect.. She did fine! FM has our phone number but she hasn't called us at all since we dropped her off friday morning. We haven't called her b/c we dont want to upset her if she's doing fine.. kwim? Regardless, she flies in tomorrow!! :)  \n",
      "Thanks for the advice Milehighdad!! I have wanted to call her the past few days but we decided against it b/c we didn't want to upset her needlessly. I will call later this afternoon when hubby is home & we can all say HI again :)  \n",
      "Congrats!!  \n",
      "If you want to change them, by all means do it. They are still young enough that they'll adjust fine in my opinion.. Sure it might take some time- if you do decide to do it I'd call them by both their new first name & old first name, slowly dropping the old first name. We've adopted 4 times (ok the last two are finalizing next month but I'm counting them..)#1- placed at birth, parents disappeared after saying they were going to surrender (but never did) at 3mo. We renamed her at that point and called her the new name from then on. Considering Bmom was court ordered to name her, I knew there were no real family ties in the name anyway. #2- placed at 5yrs old , biological sibling to #1- we knew her name since we got #1 (she's older, just wasn't taken into care). We were used to her name by the time we finally met her.. We kept her first name & just changed the middle & last. She had no problem with the middle/last name changes.#3- placed at birth- will be 4.5 when adopted, changed his name completely. We've been calling him his full new name since 2.5 (when TPR was done) but his middle name (what we will go by) is actually a nickname of his old first name which we have always called him since birth.. If he hears me call him his old name (drs, prescriptions ect..)he gets very upset and corrects me immediately.#4- placed at birth- will be 2.5 when adopted- changed his name completely. We've always called him by a nickname and it works for his new name as well :) Good luck in whatever you decide..  \n",
      "Adoption #1- We changed our AD's name at 3mo.. We never called her her birth name, just terms of endearment. She has never been called her birth name- birthparents were MIA after 2mo. Adoption #2- Came to us @ 5.5yrs old. We left her first name -mainly because we had known about her for 4.5yrs (AD's full sibling) and knew her by that name. It grew on us.. We did change her middle.Adoption #3 & 4 (pending)- both boys are having their names changed completely. Both have been with us since birth (now 2 & 4) and have always been called a nickname which will be their new names.  \n",
      "Aww! Congrats!! Hoping to follow you soon :)  \n",
      "Congrats ! I'm so happy for you, hoping to follow soon.. is this state slow or what ? !  \n",
      "We got our oldest AD last summer as an adoptive placement. I went in and spoke personally to the principal when registering her for Kindergarten & the school had no problem allowing her to use her new name immediately. They did say that they'd need to put her legal name on the official records and would amend it when the adoption was finalized.. But they always referred to her as the new name & even taught her that when learning to spell her name.  \n",
      "I've actually dealt with this on both sides- as a potential foster parent & as a potential adoptive parent. The foster situation was a newborn that DCS was planning to take into custody- the adoptive parents came forward & proved that the adoption plan was in place prior to birth & DCS getting involved so they were able to take the child home. I do believe that DCS kept tabs on them until the Bmoms time to change her mind was up. As a potential adoptive parent, I also spoke to my atty regarding a drug exposed baby that we knew DCS would most likely take. He agreed that as long as the plan was in place prior to the birth, we would have no problems getting custody. Good luck!  \n",
      "I agree, we had a potential situation this past winter.. DCS was watching BM b/c she'd already dropped dirty @ dr & probation and she wanted to give the baby to us for adoption. All we would have had to do was have an atty and do the paperwork & DCS wouldn't have stepped in.. Bmom didn't end up going thru with it (Bdad issues) and in the end DCS didn't step in either..  \n",
      "That's wonderful!! When we got TPR by default it was Mar and we finalized the adoption in mid-June of that year :) Good luck!  \n",
      "I also have a rager and she is one that you cannot talk to once she has started or it just escalates. Depending on the situation she is sometimes put in her bed to get her \"fits\" (as she calls them) out and then comes out to cuddle , other times she sits with me while I hug her and try talking quietly and calmly. Sadly at this point most of her tantruming is done in her bed bc we do have 5 other children- 3 being younger than her- and for them to be safe I can't have her out with them yet can't leave them alone either. I do love all the great advice everyone has given! I hope something there helps you. Have you tried journaling for a few weeks to see if you can find triggers?  \n",
      "Our STBAD was placed here June 30th thru ICPC.. They also did the ICAMA to get her medicaid done. It was sent to our states ICAMA office June 14th & I had her new medicaid card a week and half later. Oddly (to me at least), my state issued her medicaid card in her adopted name.. only problem being she's not adopted yet so that's not really her legal name.. I guess they didn't want to change it once adoption finalized? Either way half her stuff is now in her birth name & the other half in her new name..  \n",
      "5yr old- We sent photo books of us and our family which were given to her once ICPC was approved. 2wks later we were able to go down to finally meet her. We met her @ 9am on a friday and she went back to the hotel w/us and spent the entire week in our hotel. After 1week we had to return her to her foster home and drive back home. 4days later she was flown & placed in our home :) We really wanted more of a transition between the foster home and us, but when we arrived to first meet the foster mom had all her belongs packed & stacked by the door. We suggested taking her out for lunch the 1st day and then returning her.. and building up to a little more each day so all the kids could get used to each other ect but FM really pushed for her to just come to the hotel and spend the entire time with us. She looked down at us when we brought her back the next day for a visit and said she'd have never drove so far (30mins). So we did pack up all her things into the van at that point and kept her til we had to go home again. Things worked out well for us since *L* didn't want to go back to the foster home at all but it was definitely not the transition we had hoped for.  \n",
      "I think that with the current economy and lots of ppl losing their jobs, it shouldn't be an issue. Good luck!!  \n",
      "We are in the process of getting our AD's full sister. She's in TX and we're in IN. At this point neither girl knows about the other's existence, they've never met ect. The CW there is planning on introducing our family with a picture and going from there. Our AD knows she's adopted but we haven't brought up siblings at this point b/c she's only 4 (turning 4 soon anyway) and figured it'd be too confusing. I need help coming up with questions to ask about *L*. I know she is very bonded to her current family and will have a difficult time leaving them.. This breaks my heart, I'd completely let her stay to avoid her pain vs having her here but the adoptive mom feels she's getting too old to adopt. From what I've gotten so far from the CW she appears to be on track for her age & has only mild behavior issues- tantrums when not getting her way, but she is the baby of the family currently with many older foster sisters. Cw asked for any suggestions I might have on transitioning as well.. Thoughts??  \n",
      "Thanks for the wishes;) Yes the plan is for us to adopt her.  \n",
      "Woohoo!! Congrats!  \n",
      "We started fostering in Jan '05 , adopted our first placement last summer & are hoping to adopt our current placement.. When that's final we will most likely take a break for a while..  \n",
      "If your child is considered 'special needs' (which they both would be since they receive adoption subsidy) then yes you should get the full adoption credit for each even though you most likely paid nothing for the adoption! We adopted our FD this summer and will be taking advantage of it :)  \n",
      "Cristi727-- we just went to the SS office and told them that our daughter was just adopted from foster care and for security reasons we would like a new SS# issued. They just needed a copy of her adoption papers & her new birth certificate and got her a new # ! good luck!  \n",
      "I agree with LBs. How did the mom dress? To me, it would say that she was trying to fit in and not make her mom/family feel bad that she had all the nicer stuff?? I'm not really sure but that's what I would think of.Good luck!  \n",
      "Binny-- I'm pretty sure we're going thru the same \"sending\" state :) If you want to email me privately (canate@verizon.net) we can be ICPC buddies! For us, it took about 2wks for it to get from Sending state to my county which was super fast! But then my county decided that my adoption homestudy was goign to expire soon and is making me redo it :scream:!! So that's holding things up here. According to what I last read, federal law states that your own state only has 50days to get their part done (from the time that your state's ICPC office makes a referral )..  \n",
      "I'm still a bit jealous that you've already gotten visits and I have to wait for ICPC approval before I can have any contact! Lol! Good luck! You've nudged ahead of me :) It'd be wonderful if you could just fly them home with you after the weekend!! Fingers crossed!!  \n",
      "In my area, they wont even alert the hospitals b/c in their eyes the baby is NOT a baby until born. We tried to get them to do something about FS's (1)biomom b/c she was not receiving prenatal care for him & had a very serious medical issue that could have possibly killed him. But nothing was done b/c they said that our state laws do not recognize a baby until it is born.  \n",

      "We were supposed to be straight foster but ended up with cases that fell into our laps and have adopted 4. Now we are 100% not adopting anymore but haven't had any placements in 2yrs either so I think we will be hanging up our fostering hat :(  \n",
      "I'm struggling to decide on this one. I talked about it briefly with another foster parent friend who is familiar with the situation and she feels it's neglectful. L is 19. She has prescription drug addiction and is prescribed subutex (ms?) to control the addiction. She has a 1yr old \"O\". When O was born, the plan had been for her to be placed with us when DCS took her (known drug issues during the pregnancy ect). The only problem? DCS never stepped forward. L is actually becoming a very good mom. O is always clean ect. We have concerns regarding domestic violence in the home but no major injuries yet. L is currently pregnant and due again soon. She is still on subutex but also takes her SO's suboxen(ms) when she runs out (ie. she takes too much). The question my friend and I have is regarding eating. O is only fed bottles of milk (not formula) at this point. The parents do not feed her solids because \"its too messy\". She doesn't really know how to eat but if you give her tiny bites she will swallow. If it's too big, she spits it out (doesn't know to chew it). Again her parents don't feed her solids (baby food or ppl food). At age 1 if there are no sensory/feeding issues (other than laziness) I know they should be eating meals and snacks. Is it considered neglectful to simply give them a bottle of milk and nothing else? This is one of those cases that reports have been made in the past and DCS has ignored so I highly doubt this is worth a report at all but I am curious to your opinions.  \n",
      "She used to get WIC but it was too much hassle to go pick up checks ect. Don't believe she's gettign it anymore. The only problem with reporting it at this stage is that the baby appears to be a healthy weight, clean ect.. I'm not sure how anyone could prove that she doesn't feed her anything other than milk until more time passes and she starts losing weight.. GRRR  \n",
      "It's been a while and I just thought I'd update.. Unfortunately it's with my disgust with our DCS system. L went on to have the new baby- it was reported to the nurses that she lied about her subutex doseage (told drs she had weaned down to 1/4 pill- when really she hadn't weaned at all) and then reported that her DH gave her one of his subuoxone pills as well -- WHILE IN LABOR. Apparently the nurses must have reported it and DCS came in to \"talk\" to her but nothing was done. Poor baby went thru withdrawls and still is but they didn't give him anythign for it in the hospital. He literally has no voice b/c he's hoarse (and has been since the first week of birth) from crying all the time. Yet another DCS report was made- this time for BD not wanting to listen to the baby so removing it to another room (bathroom) and closing the door. Again- nothing done. :( So many ppl are worried about these two little ones and DCS does nothing.  \n",
      "Thanks girls! I guess I should have clarified.. I hate to put too much out there, kwim? With the whole baby in the bathroom incident- 2 doors were shut between the parents & the baby who was in the dark bathroom in his carseat- in the middle of the day. Both parents were dead to the world sleeping with the 1yr old in the playpen-wide awake. So asleep that pounding on the door wouldn't awaken them. ugh. So much about this situation bothers me but obviously until one of those babies is physically harmed- with no doubt on who did it- or more, nothing will happen.  \n",
      "I have to wonder if after enough reports they might open their eyes and actually investigate.. I agree with you on abuse of prescription meds being so difficult.. It's not like with my kids and biomoms tested + for street drugs.. In this case the bmom is on Subutex and her DH is on Suboxone (Subutex supposedly better for pregnancy) so she can and did legally take Subutex the entire time she was pg but also was taking her DH's Suboxone.. There was no way to prove it bc by drug testing it shows up under the same category :( UGH.  \n",
      "I have \"open\" adoptions to an extent with my 4 adopted kids (adopted from foster care w/ drug parents) but my DCS does not recommend it at all & will not even offer it to parents- they prefer going to TPR. It's not enforceable bc nothing was ever in writing but it's what we talked about after TPR. I have a PO Box for any communication & one set of bparents also have my cell #. I will send pics & updates if and ONLY if they write me and ask. At this time I won't do visits. The only bparent that I would consider visits with is currently in prison (which sounds akward but he's the only one that I know my sons have a good relationship with and I don't feel would cause emotional damage at this time). Absolutely do not offer more than you are willing to commit to for the next 18yrs. I would research the legalities of entering into an open adoption- how enforecable it is and what exactly you have to do to stop visits (if you agree to them) if needed for your child's sake. Just remember, you can always do MORE than your agreement says if you wish! Good luck!  \n",
      "Congrats! Maybe I need to move to VA, huh? lol! It's always nice to hear that some states are actually providing for adoptive families. We were \"offered\" $150/mo each for my two boys who both have lots of medical issues and some behavioral. It was directly implied that if we didn't take it, they'd move them. Yeah, I don't <3 my county. lol  \n",
      "Congrats!!  \n",
      "Congrats! The waiting is soo hard!  \n",
      "I would think you would be considered a relative by your son. of course it depends on how the state wants to act. We tried to get our AD's 1/2 siblings from our own state (IN) and were told that she was adopted & never lived with them (they were newborns at the time & not even released from the hospital) so she wasn't a sibling at all. However, we were considered relatives to her sister who came into care in Texas & went thru the ICPC to get her moved here & adopted. I really believe our difficulties with our own state & AD's siblings were that they had an adoptive home already picked out (friends of the CW) and wanted them to have the kids vs us. We were not even allowed visits between the kids. Yet in between those two 1/2 siblings my then FS has a baby brother born & he was placed here as a sibling placement.. Go figure. It doesn't hurt to try! Good luck!  \n",
      "I agree with the others. I'd go ahead and register him. Worst case, he's already gone home and you can just take his name off the list & the spot will open up for someone else. Sorry you have such an absent SW.. It must be very difficult to deal with him!  \n",
      "Wow that must have been a surprise! I hope they continue to look to the best interests of their child & sign on Friday! Good luck!! PS= I just read your siggy that you expanded your family with a surro? Cool!  \n",
      "Quite honestly it depends on your CW.. I am also in Indiana and just adopted my two boys in Nov. FS1 was TPR'd for over 2yrs before his adoption was finalized, FS2-bparents surrendered & it was 3months later. (the boys are full siblings & were adopted together-- FS2 was only quicker b/c I've been bugging and bugging and bugging.. lol).Good luck!  \n",
      "2010 was a great year for us. We finalized the adoption of Southern Darlin' in April (she is a full sister to our other AD who we had since birth. SD joined us at 5.5yrs old and was adopted in 10months!). Then just before the year close (Nov), we FINALLY completed the much anticipated adoption of our two little boys (had since birth now 2 &4)!! This has been a long time coming since 4yr old has been TPR'd for over 2yrs at time of adoption! We are so thankful to finally have these kids as a permanent part of our family. It still seems funny that we never got into foster care to adopt & have just finalized our #3 &4 adoptions. In 2011, we are hoping for another foster baby or two but we will see what comes!  \n",
      "I'm also in Indiana and one who chimed in that our visits continued until TPR actually happened. Bmom missed tons of visits and they started making her call in 1hr prior to visits. Toward the end, they made her call by noon the day prior if she wanted a visit that way the visit supervisor had time to put somethign else in her place if she didn't call. I remember the days of having to be up and ready just in case she called in.. Not fun, especially not in the snowy weather. Good luck!  \n",
      "I agree with you & the others- that is not right at all. I would call the Casa's supervisor. In our area (small) we have Casa Director which is a paid position and he's above all volunteer casa's. Just call the casa office & ask to speak to the director or supervisor & report it.  \n",
      "We adopted from Texas and got our daughter's entire file (2 large binders worth of info) to keep.. We have also adopted from Indiana previously & are in the process now- we were denied looking at our daughter's file 4yrs ago & have asked several times to get copies of our STBASs files but to no avail. We have had all three since birth but it would still be nice to have a copy of their official file like our Tx AD has for when they get older.  \n",
      "I'm so glad to hear the baby is with you!! My heart is always in my throat in these situations that CPS will fail to put siblings first and put the baby elsewhere.  \n",
      "aww! Congrats!! Apparently there ARE still some placements coming thru in this area :) Have fun with him!  \n",
      "Three of my four adopted (or soon to be adopted) kiddos came to be at birth. They all know their stories as is age appropriate.. We picked up my now 5yr old at the hospital at 2days old. Her story has always been a bedtime story and she enjoys it.. Here's a link to my blog where I told the story if you want to see what we actually say ect : [url=http://homeofchaos.blogspot.com/2010/06/to-1-of-4.html]Kingdom of Chaos: To #1 of 4[/url] My 6yr old came to us at 5 yrs so we talk about how she lived with Mommy x until she was 3 and how Mommy x couldn't take care of her and she went to live with OldMom (her foster mom, she called Old Mom & me New Mom when we first transitioned) and she took care of her and loved her until she could come live with us forever and ever. My 4 yr old we also picked up from the hospital at 2days old. He is not yet adopted but knows he will be.. He actually knows his biological parents (the girls don't remember them) because his younger brother had visits after he was TPR'd.. So he knows that he came from xxx's tummy and she couldn't take care of him so he came to live with us forever and ever. My 2yr old came to us at 2wks old and well he doesn't communicate yet so we really haven't gotten into his story quite yet.. I have pics of the boys biological parents but none of the girls which I deeply regret.. I had no clue they would disappear so quickly or I'd have taken some :(  \n",
      "manderzmcg79naca, I loved reading your blog--particularly how princess responded. Too sweet.  Thanks! Spoiled Princess is the same color as us and quite honestly looks like she could be one of my biological children.. I've had ppl comment on that before- knowing that she was adopted. My two youngest that we are finalizing on next month do not have the same skin color as us. I always assumed like you- obviously they'll need to know but am giggling at some of the gum ball ideas! Honestly, I was a surrogate for some friends the year before Spoiled Princess joined our family. We are still very close friends with that family.. They chose to not tell their daughter that I carried her.. Yes she is their genetic child so they didn't want to confuse her with the how's and why's until she's old enough to understand (teens?). While I respect their decision, I don't agree with it.. I think it'll be more confusing and will perhaps come back to bite them (if it was no big deal, why did you lie to me/hide it from me.. ect). This is why I've always felt that kids should know from the beginning.. I try very hard to make it a normal part of their lives so they just always known it and it never comes as a surprise.. It's just a part of them, hence the bedtime story.. I hope that makes sense.  \n",
      "I agree- you can never tell.. Siblings SHOULD stay together but it doesn't mean they will.We tried to get our AD's two siblings (half brothers born a year apart , taken into care at birth). In both those cases, we were denied even visits.. They were placed elsewhere and have been adopted- we are allowed no contact. The bioparents even wanted them with us. On the other hand, we were placed with our FS's baby brother at birth.. but I had a better relationship with his CW (same county).. He was born in between AD's brothers so I kinda think he was given to us to placate us. Lastly we have our AD's sister- placed with us from another state. They were absolutely THRILLED to be able to put the girls together (never met) so they could preserve their sibling background. I really hope you get the new sibling but with the supervisor being against you... I hate to say it but I wouldn't hold my breath.Good luck!  \n",
      "My two girls' bmom is chronic paranoid schizophrenic & bipolar and their bdad is undiagnosed but probable bipolar as well.. Both are drug addicts. My 5yr old has a very unique way of learning & her therapist feels we'll see some type of learning disorder once we get to school, we had her since birth and don't notice any bipolar or other mental illness at this point.. My 6yr old is currently dx ADHD & anxiety disorder but at this age bipolar and ADHD mimic each other so it's very hard to tell if there will be more as she gets older.. She's only been with us for a year & has a much more abusive background than her sister who just had the drug exposure..  \n",
      "Congrats!!!  \n",
      "Ugh, I have no words.. :( I'm sorry. I too would hotline it. hugs  \n",
      "We just had the bmom of our FS sign surrender (IN) and from what I understand she can change her mind at any point until we have a court date & the judge accepts it - like a PP said. According to my CW, we could techinically file for adoption the same day.. In your case, if there is no bdad.. have they published in the paper and filed TPR on unknown bdad or is that yet to be done?  \n",
      "So sorry!! I hope you get a match soon!  \n",
      "Good luck!!! I hope you can update us with GOOD news soon :)  \n",
      "I can't imagine anyone putting their fosterchild in respite so much. Considering he's school age, during the school year she barely saw him since the weekends tend to be when I have a chance to catch up with my school age kids. ..Home from school, homework, supper & bed then to your house every other weekend?! It definitely sounds odd that she's asking for so much respite.. I have only used respite twice in my 5+yrs of fostering- both were against my will-- One was when DCS refused permission for my infant FS to go out of state & we already had paid for our Disney vacation ahead of time. The second was when his baby brother came into care and we were at Disney (hmm a theme?) so they put him in respite until we came back vs telling us they were taking him and giving us the option to come home early ( I would have.. lol)..  \n",
      "We adopted our daughter's biological sister (dd was adopted as well) from foster care in Texas and we had to wait for TPR to go thru before we were able to have any contact.. So I would agree that most likely she wont be moved until TPR has already taken place. In our case , Tx wouldn't even speak to us officially until TPR went thru (Nov. '08) and then we had to go thru the ICPC process (which they wouldnt' start until after TPR & appeal periods were up). She was finally placed here in June '09. Good luck!  \n",
      "That is confusing.. I'm not sure who they can hold you liable if they are the ones insisting on this visit and allowing an unlicensed person to supervise??  \n",
      "That is confusing.. I'm not sure who they can hold you liable if they are the ones insisting on this visit and allowing an unlicensed person to supervise??  \n",
      "I agree, you should qualify as kinship care since you have a biological sibling.. THey could place her with you w/o you having a foster license if that's the case.. Once you get your foster license then you could start receiving the per diem. Good luck!! I hope that you can get her placed with you.. I would think that would be the most preferable arrangement for all involved since you seem to have a good relationship with the bmom!Keep us updated!  \n",
      "We also lost TPR on our youngest FS back in Nov. Basically things didn't change. Bmom still had to work her plan and planned changed back from TPR/Adoption to RU.. In our case, it woke the county up to finally start doing their job.. They finally started drug testing again (she has never passed one) & as a result she quit coming.. She hasn't seen FS since Jan & we are back on the TPR path yet again.  \n",
      "Wow, I really thought they were going to end up with you. I'm sorry :( At least they are still with family but it kinda sucks after all you went thru.. Like you said though, they were a bit younger than your ideal age so hopefully you get a call soon!  \n",
      "Yes they can. For a long time, DCS planned on RU'ing my oldest FS with his dad and TPRing his mom.. They filed TPR on just his mom, not knowing dad was planning to sign surrenders to us.. With both my FSs, bdad has signed surrenders to us with the contingency that bmom is TPRd.  \n",
      "Our first placement was a newborn who's Bmom was addicted to Meth. We adopted her at 17months. A year later, bmom had moved states & was arrested (still meth addict) and AD's older sister went into care. We are in the process of adopting older sis now. Now 5yrs after our AD was taken into care- BM has switched states again, warrant for her arrest in old state & still involved in drugs. The girls Bdad is also a meth addict & has spent all the years I've known him in and out of jail. He lost 2 additional children (new bmom) during this time too.  \n",
      "What exactly is your friend recommending? Laying on their stomach? because I don't see how that would be any better as a newborn, they'd suffocate in vomit that way. I always did the side laying for my own comfort b/c I could see issues with both back & tummy sleeping.. lol. Of my 3 drug babies, only one had reflux. They all needed swaddling and slept in a swing if not being held.. The motion helped soothe. My first drug baby did not sleep at all, my 2nd always slept & the last well he's 21mo and still not sleeping thru the nite.. lol. Good luck!  \n",
      "That's ridiculous! My almost 4yr old is still having accidents.. Lots of things trigger him, so I wouldn't call him completely potty trained either.. UGH! STupid judge!  \n",
      "Does anyone know the effects on the unborn baby if the mother is addicted to various rx drugs? In the first 21wks , bmom was taking xanax (13 at once in one episode), vicodin, lortab & hydrocodone. (all stolen or bought illegally and taken for abuse not actual issues) At 21wks she was kinda forced to get on suboxone & then spent a while on that and buzpar (with prescriptions). She's now weaned off of everything because the baby is due very soon & she's on house arrest so probably not getting more but who really knows (boyfriend has issues too). I tried researching but of course everythign just talks about rx drugs & pregnancy when they are prescribed not when they are being abused. So far u/s shows the baby about two weeks smaller but otherwise looking ok. Just wondering what issues might not show up til born.The heartrate was 182 @ this appt which according to the internet (ha) is high for being 38wks.. The dr was basically in there for 2mins and it was a very quick appt. Any thoughts? Thanks  \n",
      "Thanks for all the responses! I really appreciate them!!  \n",
      "my older FS has had two heart surgeries & my youngest FS has had tonsils & adenoids out.. With all three surgeries, the CW's supervisor faxed over a signed permission and I signed everything else. I've never had a CW actually come to the surgery or any dr appts.  \n",
      "We recently went thru TPR trial on our youngest fosterson (18mo) and it came back denied. Everyone is walking around in a daze as we all (Dcs, casa, all attorneys) thought it was an open /shut case. Now DCS must attempt RU again and offer services. After talking to a few friends it was suggested that I try to get a huge list of services to give to Casa that perhaps they should offer Bmom. We all know she's still doing drugs- mulitple reports, just a matter of getting a dirty screen (long story) and basically the only thing she's currently doing is visits (which she skips out once a week). So if she's offered a zillion services and does 2 then it will look good for DCS to be offering & bad on her in court that she's not complying.. If she does them all and gets him back then at least we all know that she's really tried and is hopefully somewhat prepared. The loss of this TPR is especially hard on us as we have the full sibling who we're adoptiong. He was TPR'd last fall & this case was largely based on his TPR so it boggles the mind that we got a denial. If you could just give me a list of all the services your biological parents are made to complete, I'd really appreciate it!! The case conference is this week so the sooner the better! Thanks so much!  \n",
      "Thanks everyone for the ideas!! My FS has been in care his entire life (18months) and we've been involved with this particular Bmom for over 3 1/2 yrs thru DCS (got our older FS soon to be AS at birth & the boys are full brothers). Unfortunately the baby was born right before the TPR trial on my older FS, so the county did not put the cases together. Bmom spent a year of the past 18months in prison and Im sure that's factoring in somehow..As for housing assitance- I know she cannot get HUD housing b/c of her drug felonies. I'm assuming there is no other assistance ?Thanks again for all the good ideas!  \n",
      "breakspencilsdrug free via a follicle test. have they done one of those?  Casa requested a hair follicle test & DCS told her that they cannot do them.. Not sure it's that they really CAN\"T do it or more that they don't WANT to spend the money.  \n",
      "Update-- I took a ton of suggestions from you guys & sent to my Casa.. She fw'd to the CW and the Head of Casa also took his own list over.. DCS ignored them all. No talk of drug testing, no talk of NA/AA meetings, nothing. Instead we're now moving to supervised IN HOME (where he cannot be RU'd due to state LAW) visits.. I sure as heck hope there is something going on behind the scenes and DCS is not this stupid.  \n",

      "I'm sorry he (and you) is going thru this.. My youngest just has supervised visits with his biomom (started this summer @ 14mo) and he has the same issues after visits. I can't imagine how he would act if he was forced to see her longer or unsupervised. Right now she's only seeing him for 1-2hrs at a time. I'd report it to the CW, not that it will necessarily change anything but I'd feel better having reported it.  \n",

With that said : My first foster placement (newborn-picked up @ hospital), we adopted @ 17mo. My second & third foster placements (sibs) were here 4days before being moved to be with the rest of the sibling group. My fourth foster placement was with me for 2wks before being reuinited w/ birth parents. My fifth foster placement (13mo after my 1st) was another newborn-straight from the hospital -who is TPR'd & we are in the process of adopting (he's 3 1/2now) My sixth foster placement was also a newborn -sibling to 5th placement & we've had TPR trial, just awaiting the decision- we plan to adopt him (he's 17mo). We are also in the process of adopting the 5yr old sister (placed as adoptive placement this summer) to our 1st fosterplacement. And we have a potential foster/adopt situation in Dec- friend of the family due then.  \n",

I told her no, I didn't plan to- which she said she probably wouldn't do her kids either. I dont see how the state can force all foster kids to get it w/o parental consent.. My youngest (17mo) has H1N1 now & they believe the 3yr old already had it in Oct, so I will question if they would actually need the shot since they've both already had the virus. IF I get the letter that is. lol  \n",

      "I've went to both the TPR's for my kids so far and will be going to yet another later this month. We were allowed in the court room to listen to everything both times (I testified the 2nd time) but we do not normally get the verdict the same day. How reliable is your CW on calling you to keep you updated? Knowing my CW - I'd probably sit in the hall so I could speak to her or the attorney and find out how things went b/c she wouldnt' call me for days and I dont like the suspense. Good luck!  \n",

We have TPR coming up on our other FS later this month and it has not been mentioned whether we'll be called to testify again or not. Perhaps in your case they have plenty of ppl to testify and don't feel they would need your testimony as well>? In ours, it was just me , the CW & the visit supervisor testifying.  \n",

I have only had one case that did but it was b/c Bdad had just got out of jail & showed up to Chins court drunk. The judge made it a court order that he was not allowed do drugs or alcohol at all. The next drug screen came back ++ so visits were stopped b/c it was violation of the judge's order.  \n",

I went ahead and applied for IN medicaid and have the interview tomorrow but read on here elsewhere that the ICPC office was supposed to do that?? I foster for the state so dont' have an agency to ask and my county has been very close mouthed about helping in any way at all because \"this is an ICPC\" situation.. I do have an email in to the ICPC worker @ the state level but naturally he's out of the office on vacation.  \n",

They are supposed to be calling me for an interview tomorrow so I'll find out for sure what's going on then and hopefully they can answer some questions finally! I assume at least a real person and not an automated system has to interview me! :)  \n",

      "Hi, Just a quick intro then a question. We are in Utah and we are matched with a baby boy due Jan 15. I know we have to wait until we finalize to have him sealed, but can we do the baby blessing before that? I keep forgetting to ask my bishop, so if anyone knows that would be great. Thanks Rachel  \n",
      "I really don't know much about most of your post, but I would love to be apart of number 5, I don't know if I personaly would want to be hosted but I would definatly host. Also as far as OA maybe coming up with some questions for the pap, and the emom's to ask each other, and helping them get those questions rolling. That was the one thing I really needed help with and felt our agency just didn't do enough of. Rachel  \n",
      "I'm against the $85,000,000,000.00 bailout of AIG.  Instead, I'm in favor of giving $85,000,000,000 to America in a We Deserve It Dividend.  To make the math simple, let's assume there are 200,000,000 bonafide U.S. Citizens 18+.  Our population is about 301,000,000 +/- counting every man, woman and child. So 200,000,000 might be a fair stab at adults 18 and up..  So divide 200 million adults 18+ into $85 billon that equals $425,000.00.  My plan is to give $425,000 to every person 18+ as a We Deserve It Dividend.  Of course, it would NOT be tax free. So let's assume a tax rate of 30%.  Every individual 18+ has to pay $127,500.00 in taxes. That sends $25,500,000,000 right back to Uncle Sam.  But it means that every adult 18+ has $297,500.00 in their pocket. A husband and wife has $595,000.00.  What would you do with $297,500.00 to $595,000.00 in your family? Pay off your mortgage housing crisis solved. Repay college loans ֖ what a great boost to new grads Put away money for college it'll be there Save in a bank ֖ create money to loan to entrepreneurs. Buy a new car create jobs Invest in the market ֖ capital drives growth Pay for your parent's medical insurance health care improves Enable Deadbeat Dads to come clean ֖ or else  Remember this is for every adult U S Citizen 18+ including the folks who lost their jobs at Lehman Brothers and every other company that is cutting back. And of course, for those serving in our Armed Forces.  If we're going to re-distribute wealth let's really do it...instead of trickling out a puny $1000.00 ( 'vote buy' ) economic incentive that is being proposed by one of our candidates for President.  If we're going to do an $85 billion bailout, let's bail out every adult U S Citizen 18+!  As for AIG liquidate it. Sell off its parts. Let American General go back to being American General. Sell off the real estate. Let the private sector bargain hunters cut it up and clean it up.  Here's my rationale. We deserve it and AIG doesn't.  Sure it's a crazy idea that can 'never work.'  But can you imagine the Coast-To-Coast Block Party!  How do you spell Economic Boom?  I trust my fellow adult Americans to know how to use the $85 Billion We Deserve It Dividend more than I do the geniuses at AIG or in Washington DC.  And remember, this plan only really costs $59.5 Billion because $25.5 Billion is returned instantly in taxes to Uncle Sam.  Ahhh...I feel so much better getting that off my chest. Kindest personal regards,  Blaine  PS: Feel free to pass this along to your pals as it's either good for a laugh or a tear or a very sobering thought on how to best use $85 Billion!! PSS: This is a forward I got, and would really like to do. Rachel  \n",
      "This really would be perfect, at least for me. The thing is though I get really mad when I read this type of thing b/c we all know it won't happen our government will bail out a company that is paying it's CEO's 100k a month instead. (fanny mae's CEO is now one of the nominee's financial advisors and makes 117k a month in pension, even though he committed fraud to increase bonuses.) Really if someone knew a way to get plans and ideas into our government I would love to hear about it, I feel like I'm just one person that can do nothing in the big picture. And don't tell me voting makes a difference.  \n",
      "My 4 year old nephew leaned over to my sister and said, Maybe we should get Lincoln some plastic teeth since he doesnt have any. Link is 6 months.  \n",
      "I also found my mom's group on meet up and I love love love them, and honestly very rarely do they talk about pregnancy/delevery, but it doesn't bother me b/c I am intrested in it also because I have been pregnant 3 times just haven't made it to the hospital delevery! These are the women I go to when I have problems, we have breakfast meetings a few times a week and we just sit around and chat for 3 hours while the kids play and if my boy is cranky (he's 6 months) some one always holds him for me so i have a little break. We also do ittsy bittsy play groups where I'll have any baby's that can't walk yet over and the baby's really enjoy getting to know each other and sharing toy's. We all have things we are sensitive about, after you get to know your group just tell them I'm sure they won't be mad to hear how sad it makes you feel when people talk about pregnancy, they will understand. oh and I told everyone right away that Lb is adopted because I wanted to form lasting relationships with the ladies and I wanted them to know where I was coming from. Plus Lb's black and the hubby and I are not. Rachel  \n",
      "My sister's boy is not even 2 yet and he talks in his sleep. He gets going and you can talk to him and ask him to do things and he does them it is so funny to watch. a few weeks ago he fell asleep in the livingroom and started talking so I asked him to show me his big boy teeth and he pulls his lips back and sticks his teeth out all with his eyes closed. Kids are cute.  \n",
      "When we were kids my mom would wash our mouths out with soap if we said something bad, so one day she come's home to hear my brother bryce tatteling on my brother nolan for saying a bad word, nolan turns around and said \"Don't worry mom I already washed my mouth out with soap\" and he had! Kid's are funny, hope the tast goes away soon! Rachel  \n",
      "Ok so Lincoln weighed 7.7 at birth and yesterday at 3 months old he weighed in a a whopping 17 pounds. At his 2 month Dr visit he weighed 14 pounds, and the dr said to try and strech out how often he is eating. The thing is I only feed him if it has been at least 4 hours and he is crying to eat, I do not scheduale feed. I feel like I am making a fat little baby and am really woried. Anyone have any advise? Rachel  \n",
      "My 2 year old nephew saw our 2month old and yelled baby Jesus!, Mom look baby Jesus! It was so funny, were not sure why he thinks he's baby Jesus maybe because he's black. Rachel  \n",
      "My mom swears by it. When I was a kid if we got sick my mom would not take us to the Dr. untill we had been taking our Usana for a least 3 day's. It's become a family joke to yell at each other \" well if you had been taking your Usana!\" Check out the website and good luck! Rachel  \n",
      "My cousin's 16 month old baby just started crawling, she would do the army pull with her arm's, and if they put her on a cold surface, like tile, she would kind of crawl to a more warm spot. They started doing PT with her and right away she started to crawl. She is very small for her age though she only weighs 14 pounds, but her dr had her evaluated and everything seems fine she's just a small baby.  \n",
      "Hi, I love my Jeep stroller that I got at shopko for like 20 dollars. I got it when I tended my sisters boy, and it was great because it came with extra side storage bags. I have been looking at the Mclearen one's online and really like them but haven't bought one yet, I'll wait and see if my jeep ever wears out. Rachel  \n",
      "Ok so we brought our son home last Thursday, and because we are idiot's we never checked to see if the car seat would fit in the car properly, well it doesn't. I have a Honda Civic and in order to even put the baby seat in we have to move both front seats all the way forward, then once the baby seat is in I can move the front seat's back a tiny bit. I have a baby trend's car seat so it's not like it's some huge seat. Well yesterday I had a 9:00 appointment, and the day before it snowed well I got stuck in a parking lot in like 2 inches of snow, and a stranger had to tow me out with his truck. I am so frustrated with the Civic I just want to go park it in a bad neighborhood with the doors unlocked. And the husband is freaking out about we have to buy a Suburban, we have one kid but want more, because he doesn't want to have to buy a new car again in 5-7 years. So besides this being a vent, what does everyone think about the Volkswagen Touareg. If I get a V8 we can use it to tow our Jeep (that we trailer, it's off road only) and it has tons of room for us and the dog's can fit in the back. Has anyone had one, or something similar, I don't want something too big, but I want something with 4 wheel drive. Any suggestions or comments would be great. Thanks Rachel  \n",
      "Thanks so much for the great feedback! I thinks I was mostly just having one of those day's where you need to sit down and cry then take a nap. I think I have the hubby talked into on the VW we are going to look at it one more time today. You ladies are great, it's nice to know I have some where to vent, and people respond and care. Thanks Rachel  \n",
      "Ok so here is the update then I'm going to try to post some pic's. On the 15th Lincoln was born at 7.7 pounds and 19 inches we brought him home yesterday and he is doing great. He looks just like his 10 month old brother and I just cant get enough of him. I'm in love. :D  [ATTACH]72099[/ATTACH]  \n",
      "I made a 8 by 8 scrap book with all the pic's we took together before the birth, and then pics at the hospital, and I left some blank pages in it so I can send update's and she can slide them in. She loved it. I didn't give it to her untill the day she left the hospital and that morning I saw her looking at it several times. I also made a matching scrap book for Lincoln that is his only and has all the same pics and page layout's. We spent about 4 weeks together with Lincoln's two brother's and A. and so we had lots of pic's of us doing stuff together, but you could just do hospital pic's, I made the layout's before hand so all I had to do was print the pic's and slide them in.

      "Hi so I don't know what is right for you but as far as her life being crazy with school right now that is more than a real posibility, for me next week is finals so this week I has 2 huge projects ans one 15 page paper that is due in about 2 hours (he he i should be working on it, but it's almost done) AND next week I have 2 finals in one day, not to mention the other finals, my house is a wreck, and the dog's and my hubby think I disapeared! So if I were you I would talk to the agency see if they know what's up, or if the could call just to check in on her. Then if things still feel unresolved consider wrighting an email. Hope this was helpfull. Rachel  \n",
      "Ok so my cordinator called and wants to send our profile out on a emom that is having twins, the thing is though she is having a boy and a girl and want to only place the girl. This seems really weird to me and the hubby. I also worry that this is a high risk adoption plan for us, and just need some general advice. Thanks Rachel  \n",
      "If it was up to me I would keep the twins together, but it is not. I am really just looking for some feed back on potential problems, and wondering how others feel about this type of situation. I would love to be a mom to twins and have a boy and a girl. But it may be too hard to deal abandonment issues later in life. Rachel  \n",
      "I've been hanging around and this is my first post, so... I was at work talking to a girlfriend about going to see my mom (3 hours away) and going boating, when this guy turns around and say's Can I come? I said I'm going to Vernal, He said I know, I said it's 3 hours from here, He said I know, I said I'm not coming back untill monday (it was thursday) He said that's ok. So I picked him up and we went boating together all weekend and he fell in love. I fell in love a few weeks later.  \n",
      "Because it's just me and the hubby, and he is the photographer, we had tons of pic's of just me! Luck for us my sister is a professional and she did a couple of evenings worth of photo's so we could change our cloths and hair style. That worked best for us. But we still ended up using a few older photo's where my hair was really long and we look very different. Hopefully it will all turn out ok though. Rachel  \n",

It's been two months since we sent the second set in, and we havent heard anything. I keep calling my agency and they just say maybe next week. We are in Utah and I'm not sure if there is anyone we can call to try and track them down, or what a realistic wait time is. If you have any information please let me know. Thanks Rachel  \n",

I love it and will never go with out it, infact when we go out to my mom's, she has a dog also, I take it with me and use it at her house. If your looking for a way to cover up the smell, I put a few cinnamon sticks and an orange in a small pot, add water and let it simmer, it smells great but it's just a cover up. Rachel Roomba  \n",

      "\"Nails In The Fencepost\" A young boy got in trouble, and when his dad told him he was grounded, the young boy shouted, \"I HATE YOU!!!\" The dad thought for a minute, then asked the boy to grab a handful of nails and a hammer, and meet him in the back yard by the fence. The dad pointed at a fencepost and instructed the boy to hammer all the nails into the fencepost. The son complied. The next day the dad walked his son back out to the fencepost and told the son to remove all the nails he'd hammered in the day before. When the son completed that task, the father told the son to look at the shoddy condition of the fencepost. It was full of holes, too many to repair. The dad explained that even if the boy filled in the holes, the fencepost would never look the same again. Likewise, if they went out and got a new fencepost, this one would still have holes in it for the rest of its days. The father then explained that hurtful words act like nails. They make holes in people's hearts which are every bit as permanent and damaging. Once something is said, it can't be unsaid. Apology can be made in an attempt to fill in the hole, but the person will still never be the same. The hole is there, and it'll be there forever. This could be a very easy lesson to teach, and you wouldn't have to use nails if you didn't want to. Hope this helps. Rachel  \n",

      "Reading your post, I actually had a lot less black and white feeling about the situation. I honestly don't think diversity should be the only factor, but I'm less likely to say academic standing should be either. My perspective is from a person who has tutored different children who go to NYC schools over the past four years, they range from 3rd graders to 7th graders. I can tell you that some of the kids who went to some of the best academic rated elementary schools were only taught to do well on tests, they tended to have no diversity in their learning, and I honestly feel they weren't as good at learning. On the other hand, some of the kids who went to schools who had a lower rating actually had a much better ability to think creatively, do logical thinking, and had learned more than what was on a standardized test. Much of it depending on their teachers (as is the norm), but IMO going to a \"good\" school definitely didn't make a good student, in fact I was told by one 4th grader who went to a really good school when I explained why the answer she was giving was incorrect that I wasn't being fair because I wasn't giving a multiple choice problem. At the end of the day, with ALL the kids I tutored, their success had much less to do with the school they went to and more to do with their parents involvement - the kids who had parents who didn't care or just wanted improved test scores tended to have students who were IMO short-sighted about learning. Kids whose parents asked questions, wanted to know what they were learning, tried to be involved in the education process had kids who were more well rounded and were getting a good education. Again, just trying to show a different POV, but especially in NYC it's just not straightforward. Just wait until your little one gets to HS, then choosing a school goes to a new level of confusing.  \n",
      "Unfortunately all my kids were from Queens and Manhattan, no Brooklynites, so I don't know much about the elementary schools there. If you want to send me the names over PM I could see if any of the other tutors I know, or even other parents I know have opinions of them. I hope you get into school #3 as well, but if you don't, just follow your gut. I think schools with a strong administration and good parent involvement to me is as important if not more important that academic standings, that on top of a good curriculum in the arts (something I'm a real sucker for) and a diverse student body to me seems like a great option. For me it comes down to the extra walk and whether you think it's doable (as a girl who walks 25 minutes to work each way, I can appreciate how hard that can be in 9\" of snow!)  \n",
      "I don't know how common it is or isn't. I know in my instance I don't know the race of the biodad. I do know he is at least part AA. He always identified himself as AA, and looked AA, but once told me his Dad was of German and English decent (I wish four years later I would have thought to take note of what exactly he said as it's my only clue as to the makeup of my son). I never knew whether his dad was CC, or BR, or what. I told the aparents I wasn't sure but thought he was biracial. I think the biodad may contact me again and it's one of the main things I want to try to find out (that and medical history), but it's a really touchy thing with him. I feel as the birthmom I somehow failed because I didn't have those answers for the aparents. I have found it frustrating for me. My experience is much less extreme, we basically know what races he is, just not the amounts of each one. I sort of have assumed he is 1/2CC and 1/2 AA because our son has blue eyes but that's just my putting a broad assumption on it. I will say though that I know many people who are bi-racial and yet don't really define themselves as the races that make up who they are. My roommate for example (who is 1/2 AA, 1/4 hispanic, 1/4 CC) won't ever tell people \"what she is\". When they ask (which is quite a lot) she usually says, oh I was born in Colorado, or I'm American. I realize it's a different deal when you have to react that way not because of choice but because you don't actually know. How old is your daughter? Is she old enough to have dealt with any of that yet?  \n",
      "I can't tell you what your nephew is thinking or feeling, but I can tell you some of what I went through as a birthmom who placed with non-relatives in an open adoption. I was excited to meet my son, I had bonded and loved this child beyond what I could explain for the entire pregnancy. I knew that I would have to go through with a heartbreaking decision in a few days, but I also knew that this would be the only time that I was the mother to my child, and I wanted to appreciate that time as much as possible. I wanted those memories and so I kept my son close by and enjoyed our time in the hospital. But I completely agree with those on this post, until your nephew is a father (and his girlfriend a mother), he won't know what he's giving up, and it's his right and he needs to be able to change his mind after he actually is a father. Again I don't know how he's feeling, but I can say that with me, hearing about how hard it would be, meeting my son, or going through it all wasn't going to deter me from what I knew was best for my son. I was going in with open eyes, if you feel like your nephew isn't I would encourage you to make sure he confronts what's happening. This isn't something that you want to have regrets about, I think they would haunt you through the rest of your life.  \n",
      "I have to say that in my case my son's parents held off our first visit until 6 weeks, and since then we visit about once every two months (he's 17 months right now). I really wanted to see him earlier than that because the first three weeks I was not allowed to work (healing and health issues) and really wanted to see them during that time, but I think they needed a break. I can't say visits made it easier, or harder, it made it both. Seeing him helped me come to terms with the child he was becoming and that I wasn't his Mom anymore, but saying goodbye always was hard. Knowing there would be another visit helped some. I get frustrated when people assume visits are this amazing thing for bparents, like you can see your child so it will make everything better, because it really is just a reminder of what you gave up, but again, I had a million different reminders everyday that I gave up being a Mom to the most amazing boy, so at least with a visit the reminder comes with the joy of seeing him and seeing the life he has. But each person will react differently - each bparent ou there has a different view. Honestly you shouldn't decide what they would want, but only decide what you are comfortable with. I will say it was really hard to ask for things when I was a new bmom, I kept thinking I was over-stepping and I worried constantly about the adoption closing. So being very open about what you're comfortable with and how you're proceeding will most likely put them more at ease to be able to ask for things they want (for instance saying \"just let me know if you want a visit, or let me know if you want more pictures\", etc). Good luck, it can be a bumpy road.  \n",
      "Fortunately NYC didn't get hit nearly as badly as they feared. I never lost power, and aside from a few branches down around the neighborhood didn't see any damage. I know a few areas were flooded, but the suburbs were hit much harder than us. I hope all of you in the harder hit areas got through it all okay.  \n",
      "Linny IMO, you owe her nothing else, period.   I have met very few birth mothers who are in open adoptions because they feel that they are owed anything. I personally feel very strongly I owe it to my child to get to know him as he grows and let him get to know me so he has a sense of his nature half. That desire towards maintaining the connection with him did not really manifest until he was born, I very much changed what I wanted from the relationship after he was born, but it was never because of what was owed me, but rather what I felt we all owed our child. to the OP, I honestly believe you need to do whatever is best for your child. As long as you feel confident the reasons you choose to keep the relationship as is (or change it) are reasons you'll be able to explain to your child when they are an adult and still feel good about, then I'm sure they are the right reasons. I think if you choose to keep a semiOA then just be sure to be honest with the bmom about it. As far as the identifying information - I really wanted to know my son's name, his full name. Even in the beginning when I was talking to my SW about having a closed adoption I knew I needed to know my son's name. Maybe that's part of it more than wanting to know your name.  \n",
      "questioningWe have an older house with a banister at the top of the stairs and our SW was obsessed with the gaps in this! But we found out shortly after that a friend down the street who has two kids was also told hers (same thing) was dangerous as kids can get their heads stuck in the rails so she sold us some safety stuff when she moved to a new house. I'm sort of embarassed to say this and it's totally off topic but I got my head stuck in our banister when I was a kid twice. I'm sort of at the point where it's kind of funny, but it still really hurt.  \n",
      "If you were in charge, what would the laws say? 1. Openness of adoptions? (Who would decide what openness would exist? Would it be enforceable by law?)I think if aparents and bparents agree to an open adoption before it happens then both parties should be bound to legal mediation if they don't fulfill the OA. I do think people's lives change and in so OAs should be able to change, but both parties need to agree how that works. 2. Pre-birth expenses: Yes or no? Time limit or money limit? I know people don't always believe in birth expenses and I think the system is taken advantage of too often by desperate bparents and aparents. But I honestly had to not take recommended leave from work because I couldn't afford it and didn't qualify for any aid. I had to weigh the risks of working full time when I was at risk for pre-eclampsia over not being able to pay rent and buy food. For me lost wages and medical expenses both seem like legitimate expenses. I also believe that almost all bmothers (at least the ones who work) have lost wages from a pregnancy and ignoring that fact to me makes women make decisions about their health and the baby's health based on money which is bad. I do think expenses should be paid by agencies, and not by specific matched parents, and there should be regulations on what is acceptable. 3. Relinquishment: Can terminate rights before birth? Amount of time between birth and ability to terminate rights?  I know 72 hours is tossed around a lot but honestly I don't think you should be able to sign TPR at 72 hours. I was so hormonally unbalanced at 72 hours I was not of sound mind. It was a good two weeks before I was clearheaded at all. I sort of think a month seems to make more sense. 4. Rescindment of termination of rights? Should there be an amount of time where a birthparent can sign TPR and then change their mind? If so, how long?  If there is more time before having to sign TPR then it should not be rescinded. 5. When would eparents be matched with PAPs at the earliest? I personally chose pre-birth matching because it allowed me to feel comfortable with the parents I chose for my son. But my agency didn't pressure me, the adoptive parents weren't overbearing, didn't attend dr. appt, weren't overly involved in my life, and were always vocally acknowledging I was the parent until I signed TPR. I would feel very different about pre-birth matching if that experience wasn't the same. I think aparents need to be educated to not think of a baby as theirs until TPR is signed even if they do a match at 6 or 7 months (and yes I know that is easier said than done) and if they can't do that then they should wait for a mother who doesn't want to match until after birth. 6. Birthfathers: What would the rules be around birthfathers? What if the birthfather doesn't know, or the birthmother names someone (knowingly or unknowingly) that is not the biological father? Putative registry?  I think its a hard thing. In theory I would want all efathers officially notified they have a child on the way and that adoption is being considered so they can make a child care plan and file for custody if they choose. But in reality I know my son's birth father didn't want him adopted and wouldn't sign TPR but wasn't capable or willing to raise him, he just wanted me to do it so he could play Daddy on his schedule. He was notified about the pregnancy and chose to not give me any emotional or financial support during it. He knew when I gave birth and chose to not come to the hospital. I never gave the agency his contact info so he never signed TPR, but had every opportunity to step forward. I don't know if it was fair to him but I do believe it was the best for my son. If I would have named him and he would have refused to sign TPR I'm not sure what I would have done. I wouldn't have wanted my son's bdad to raise him though (and I don't say that out of spite but rather to protect my son from his bdads life).  \n",
      "belleinblue1978 And I just have to add, the most important law that I would change is records, records should not be sealed. Adopted people should be able to know the truth of who they are, it is a basic civil right. My birth certificate is a lie, as much as my folks are my parents and I love them and now they have done everything they could for me, my mom didn't give birth to me and I don't think it is fair that M and H are legally erased from my life. Well said. I don't understand this law. I don't understand who the proponents for keeping these laws the same are. And I hate the fact that most people don't even know these laws exist, I didn't know these laws existed until I was placing. It's definitely a civil rights issue and one that needs to be changed.  \n",
      "Raven, I'm curious because I don't actually know the answer to this. My SW is the only person I talked to at the agency. My conversations with her was the only way they got information, about my background, about the birth father and his thoughts on placement, about my take on adoption, about whether I drank during pregnancy. When I chose PAP I know they were told information about me and given the opportunity to accept the match. I do believe it's important for an agency to provide PAP with information about the match, but if an agency approaches counseling where they don't divulge information from those sessions to anyone else, how do they get information from the emom in order to provide it to the PAP? Again, I think my SW didn't share a lot of what I told her, but the fact the family was told anything made me stop trusting the system and stop treating them like it was counseling.  \n",
      "LauraLizI agree that the term counseling seems somewhat inadequate and support may be the better term. Our agency has a birthparent social worker and an adoptive couple social worker. They are in charge of the counseling...how well trained they are I guess is up for debate. From our experience we never heard much about the birthparent counseling. We were given updates...C is still wanting to make an adoption plan or L is really hurting right now, but she knows it was the best choice for her baby. No details. I would have been really uncomfortable if I felt that her trust and privacy was being violated. Even when our one adoption failed, her social worker was very much the advocate of the birthmother and did not say anything to jeopardize her role. Did you hear anything about the emom pre-placement? Like her age, whether she was employed, if she was with the efather, whether she drank, did drugs, if she was close to her family, whether she had siblings? My point is all that information for me was told to the agency in what I would have called a counseling session. For me, it's a really fine line to tow when they start telling PAP information, no matter what it is. It always bothered me that I didn't know which information about myself they shared with the PAP. To this day there are things they were told about me that was just wrong. Like what my father did for a living or where I went to college. I would have preferred filling out an information sheet they could read over, because at least that way I knew what I was sharing and they knew the information was accurate.  \n",
      "I would have been more than happy to create a profile for PAP to look at, including pictures, and information about myself. I have no problem about the information going back and forth. But gaining that information should be separate from options counseling. I do think that if they use \"counseling\" sessions to gain that information that is shared, then it shouldn't be called counseling. Counseling should be done by third parties who aren't associated with the agency and who abide by confidentiality. All just my opinion.  \n",

      "Amilynn... I just wanted to say that I never took your post as judgement over whether she should parent or not. I don't think anyone can answer that except her. I think part of what I was reacting to was you seemed to be asking how you could explain to your daughter that her bmother could make a different decisions on parenting when she was in the same position in her life as when she placed. I personally feel the moment I placed, I could never be in the same position in life again, I was a completely different person. My relationship immediately changed with the bdad, my own feelings about who I was changed, the way I approached my life changed, my priorities changed. I know after 16 months I have changed so much, and I can't imagine in another 16 months I won't be leagues away from who I was when I first placed. I don't think anyone in my life recognizes how much I changed that day, and each day since, on the surface my life looks the same, but honestly I am such a different person, one that would approach an unplanned pregnancy completely differently. I feel like if you understand J may be different now if for nothing else than just because she knows what it's like to place, than helping your daughter find answers about this may be easier for you. But I appreciate your ability to focus this away from your opinions on the situation and onto how it impacts your child. I hope in the end your daughter is able to appreciate a relationship with a new sibling and never doubts how much she is loved by all involved, something that's clear from your posts.  \n",

I should have noted this there!! ha ha ) I don't think I've ever shaken in public though....ha ha  My boss (who has an office with a door) will wait until he is in the same room with me to start, and it takes him like 5 minutes of shaking apparently to get it mixed properly, I just can't deal.

      "thanksgivingmomJust the way it sounds! A person that smacks their oatmeal. Occasionally she'll even talk with her mouth full of it. (The best part is that she thinks she's the most professional one at the office - uh, really???) As someone that's not a fan of oatmeal anyway, the combo of the sight, smell, and SOUND of it it just too much for me. (And yes, I've mentioned it to her politely) The thought of that makes me feel icky. I can't stand certain kinds of sounds at all, and that would definitely fall into that category  \n",
      "I don't know why this thread bothers me as much as it does, but I'm sure it's because of the way names were dealt with in my situation. Please read this realizing I see it specifically from my own perspective which may be a little jaded. What I will say is this, first I think it is a form of deceipt to promise something you're not comfortable with, and I think that includes saying you'll keep the name but then calling the child something else, and then just change it later. It's one thing to have an issue you feel differently about later, but letting her believe something while she still has the chance to change her mind and then changing as soon as she no longer has a say is not only unfair but a really bad way to start out a new relationship with someone. Second, if this is a big deal to her I don't think you should push her to compromise. Honestly, an emom needs to prioritize when matching with a family the things that are important - if this issue is a big priority for her, and if she thinks she matched with you with the understanding that you were going to keep the name, and now you want to talk about compromises I think it's unfair. I found it really hard as an emom to stand up for the couple of things that were important to me, and having someone try to talk me out of those things would have left a bad taste in my mouth and made an ongoing relationship difficult. If this is a make or break issue for you then let her know now, she should have the option to choose a couple who can agree to those things that are important to her.  \n",
      "I will say I have preferred visits in a house or a park over visits in a restaurant. All I want to do is hold my son, and talk to his parents, instead at a restaurant holding him is hard, everyone is distracted by food and my son starts getting antsy after about 45 minutes. A park or someplace where I can play with my son is always really nice and something I prefer. Also a park might be good if your son gets bored, so he doesn't start being distracting. I personally think inviting them to your home is a great idea because she can see more of your normal life which is nice, but can see if you would be worried about your house and being a hostess then I wouldn't do it. Good luck, it sounds like an exciting time for you.  \n",
      "If it makes you feel any better, I'm sure the nerves are in both directions, I can't tell you how many sleepless nights I spent leading up to visits, especially that first visit, because I was such a ball of nerves. Anyways, good luck and have fun with it all...  \n",
      "I'm a birth mother in a domestic infant adoption, so I realize my circumstances are different. I just wanted to say there has been times I wanted to ask for more, maybe I wanted an update or pictures if I hadn't heard for a few months, etc, and people in my life encouraged me to reach out. I think a hint like this that she might want more contact could be her way of asking if you would be willing. If you're not comfortable with any more than you already do, just tell her. I have no sense of your history with her so I have no idea if she's overstepped in other ways, but just looking at the email she sent it doesn't seem to be more than just testing the waters. I could easily see encouraging another bmom to send something similar if she really wanted pictures more often. I personally don't feel it's bad to put it out there if you're interested in more in a relationship like OA, worse case the other party says no, but at least you put it out there in case they wouldn't mind more contact but just hadn't thought to offer it. Now if you say no and she starts sending similar emails every month, or not respecting your decision then I could see having to be more stern with it and being firm in reinforcing boundaries. Later that day, back at the office, my colleague remarked, \"She really does love him, doesn't she?\" and the truth is - she does. She loves him completely. and she loves to see him and hear about him and visit him. She will never be his every day parent. She will never be anyones every day parent. But she does love him. and that turns out to be a blessing for him and for me.  This is so true, I do love my son so much, I want to tell everyone about him, show off pictures of him whenever I get them, and I could listen to stories about how he's doing for hours. I personally love that you are able to consider that sort of love a blessing to you.  \n",
      "hope2haveThe emom hasn't had any counseling, and I guess it is terrible (and I wouldn't say this anywhere but here) but she is so close off to the idea, her own mother described her to me as cold and closed off... I just can't help but think that if she continues this mindset, they'll be less of a chance that she will change her mind at birth? I don't know, I just know that I am SO desperate for this to work...  To me that is a huge red flag that she hasn't processed what emotions she is going to go through. I am a person who approaches everything in life logically, including my placement plan. It made sense to place, I didn't see any other option. But I was blindsided by how connected I felt to my son when he was born, how hard the placement was, how much I cried about placing him - I'm a person who can count on one hand how many times I cried in adulthood, until I placed - then I started crying publicly and multiple times a day for months. I had no idea the kind of grief I'd experience, and I had counseling and people telling me I'd experience grief prior to placement. It doesn't matter how closed off she seems, I think at some point that will break. Whether she sees her child in the hospital or not, I think she will feel the emotion of letting that child go. I think she will still have to deal with the grief. I do think it's harder if you're not expecting the kind of grief you're going to feel to let go of your child. As far as openness, honestly, what everyone else has said, it's not about bparents, it's not about aparents. It's about the kids, them having answers, them seeing the parts of themselves in each of their parents. Them understanding they weren't abandoned but that their birth parents wanted to give them the gift of a life they couldn't provide. It's not an easy road for sure, it's difficult to navigate a relationship with people you barely know, especially one so emotionally difficult. But to me, all the difficulty is worth it if my son's life is one iota better for me being a part of it. If nothing else, I would never want either me nor my son's parents to have to tell him the reason he didn't know me is that I (or they) felt like establishing a relationship would be too hard on us. I am prepared to do anything to make my son's life better for him, and having an open adoption even when it's difficult is just one more thing on that list.  \n",
      "I'm all for sending it. If he isn't ready for it then he won't open it, but when it comes to being a birth parent, more often than not the good stuff comes with grief, they can't be separated. For me, not hearing would have be so much worse than the hearing from them. The email I got on Mother's Day was hard to read, but also so amazing, and to be acknowledged on that difficult day meant more than I can explain.  \n",
      "Honestly, I completely understand not telling people about a pregnancy, sometimes you need to just gain your own strength about what you feel and how you're proceeding before you can listen to other's opinions on it. I didn't tell anyone I was pregnant until I was 6 months because I needed to process (for myself) and come to terms with how I felt about it before other people's opinions started bombarding me. It had nothing to do with trust or that I thought they would judge me, but when all was said and done I didn't want this huge decision I made to be anyone's but my own. I also believe that if she was in a bad situation before and placed her child she showed she is willing to do something that was incredibly difficult to do in order to put the needs of her child first. If she feels she can parent I think supporting her in that is the best thing you can do for her and her child. I'm not talking about financially or anything, but just telling her congratulations.  \n",
      "My OA with my son's family is one where we have all direct contact (nothing through the agency). We email, they post pictures to an online photo gallery for me to download when I want, and we have visits (so far about once every other month). I know where they live, I've been to their house, but that doesn't mean I'd ever come over uninvited. I have their phone number, but never talk to them on the phone, and only text with them if one of us is late for a visit (or something along those lines). We are figuring out what works for us. For me, Open Adoption wasn't about what I wanted at all, it was what I thought (after speaking to my social worker) would be better for my son. It's not an easy relationship at all, you're always worried about saying the wrong thing, you don't want to push too hard or make it difficult on the adoptive family, and for me, the more I hear from them, the more I want to, yet asking for more updates seems greedy. You are put into a relationship with strangers that you're hoping is healthy and stable for the rest of your life, it's a difficult thing to do. But at the end of the day, my hope that the effort will mean my son will never doubt I love him, that I placed him because I didn't see another option but that it was the hardest thing I ever did, and that he can ask me anything he wants to so he can have a complete picture of his life. I know OA isn't perfect and there may be issues I never even thought about that might happen, but for now, it's what I feel is best for him and that's the most important thing. As far as semi-open, I have heard two different descriptions that to me are very different. One is that the adoptive family sends the birth family (either through the agency or directly) updates and pictures. The second is updates and pictures go both ways (again either through the agency or direct). Personally, I would never have considered the first choice, it seems like a way to placate the birth parent without any real benefit to the child. They (the children) still don't know what their birth parents look like, or anything about them really, they don't receive updated health histories, and they don't form a relationship so they can ask questions later in life. I think I would have preferred a closed adoption rather than a semi-open where there was only contact in one direction. But that is just me and my opinion.  \n",
      "eagleswings216I have to respectfully disagree that that is just \"placating\" the birth parent. It is what some birth parents want. In our case, we do have both ways communication through e-mail, but I have friends with one-way communication because that is all the birth parent is willing to give (and one friend in particular I know wishes she would hear from her son's b-mom to know how she is doing, so she can answer her son's questions, etc.).  I read something recently that one of the reasons agencies started encouraging semi-open adoptions (over closed) were they thought more mother's would place if they could get pictures and updates. That's what I mean about placating. I feel it was a way for bparents to feel like they got something in return, so they would be more willing to place, and didn't really have to do with benefitting the child. I think as openness grew, people began to realize that adoptees could fill in some blanks of where they came from, which is when I think the benefits for the children actually started. I really feel that if it's going to benefit the child the contact needs to go in both directions. I don't think anyone can force that to happen, and when only one part of the bparent/aparent relationship wants more openness nothing is going to change, but I still feel that for an semi-OA to benefit the child then the contact should be in both directions. And truthfully I totally feel for aparents who are in an semi OA that is one-sided. I think it's got to be so hard to feel like you have to give all the time, yet you might not be able to answer a simple question your kids have about their birth parents.  \n",
      "To me it seems strange that you felt like you were close to her your whole life but that her words seem to negate that feeling. Those words, as powerful as they are, might just be her saying something that she didn't mean or didn't think through. For me, actions speak much more than words, and if she truly treated you like family your whole life knowing you were adopted, I would think she probably sees you as family and doesn't understand the pain her words might cause, they might not reflect how she actually thinks, just her getting caught up in a conversation. Because of that, if it was me, I would talk to her, maybe tell her stories that might open her eyes to why some people place and how much adoptees can be loved by both their adopted families as well as their birth families. Sometimes people say things out of ignorance or because they weren't thinking, but it wasn't out of malice. If this was the case here then I think educating her would not only help you but the kids you adopt.  \n",
      "I can't tell you how she might feel, but I know how I felt/feel in my son's OA. MY OA is definitely one that is more organic, meaning we have nothing set in writing and just figure out as we go along. For now, with us, it is basically I'll email to set up visits or if I want to tell them something, and they'll usually reply pretty quickly (but almost all their emails are response to mine). Then once every couple of months they will send a big bunch of pictures. We have visits every couple of months, usually setting it up time wise at the previous visit. For me the most important parts are hearing about big milestones when they happen, for instance if they send out a video of him rolling over I'd love to be sent the same thing. Or if he gets a new tooth, etc. Aside from knowing what happens to my son, it also makes me feel like I'm thought about, appreciated. The other thing is if they change how communication goes I want to hear from them what is going on. No matter how unfounded it is, my fear will always be that they are going to close the adoption. So when they don't get back to an email I sent I start thinking about what I might have done or what was said. I don't think, \"oh they may be on vacation or in a particularly busy period\". The more open they are about it the easier time I have processing the changes happening. If you are finding the regular emails too much, I would suggest being upfront about it, just let her know life is getting busy and although you will be sure to update as things happen, you're not sure you can continue weekly updates. Also make sure she knows that you will make sure to respond to her emails, that puts some of it on her that if she wants more emails she had better send some as well. The more upfront you are the less likely she will feel broadsided or worried about the implications of contact changing. I wish you luck, talking openly about it can definitely be hard.  \n",
      "I completely agree that stepping back might be the right thing. It's important that the updates and contact don't make you frustrated or bitter because that won't help your son in the long run. I would say IMO taking a bit to make sure you aren't feeling angry is important, and then I would write an email basically explaining how you felt so she would understand why your actions were changing. That way if she wanted more contact she could (hopefully) make the leap that she has to follow through and reply when she says she will. This is a way to at least leave the door open even if you're not feeling like you're sitting and waiting for her to walk through it.  \n",
      "SleeplvrQuite honestly I don't think I would have taken placement if I didn't feel comfortable with the parents. They are trusting me with their child so shouldn't I trust them? I think that summarizes my feeling exactly. I would have been put off if the PAP weren't willing to share their names. I was trusting them with the thing most precious in my world. I also remember asking them at matching meeting what my son's last name would be (I was wondering with two Dad's whose name they would use and if they would hyphenate it, not thinking at all I was asking for some secret information). I was basically asking their last name, and without hesitation they told me. I think it would have been a deal breaker to not be trusted to know my son's full name.  \n",
      "I remember reading a similar thread a couple months back and it was the first time I ever even thought about privacy issues in this way. Honestly, I've never posted a picture of my son (except on a protected post on my blog) but I have posted pictures of other people, including other people's kids without a second thought. My guess is she wants to show off to her friends this incredibly important person in her life, show them how well she is doing, etc. She probably has no clue you would have an issue with her posting them. If I was you I would figure out what exactly your concern is, if it's who can see them you can check her privacy settings as a PP suggested and if she let's everyone see them ask her to limit the pictures to her friends only. If it's that she's posting other family members you can specifically mention that as an issue and hopefully she'll limit what pictures she posts. If it's posting in general than maybe there is another method where she could show off pictures to people without it being on facebook (a flickr account for instance) where people couldn't happen upon it. But it seems to me being direct about what your concern is will give her a chance to change some things without you limiting what pictures you send her.  \n",
      "yI just wanted to say good luck navigating the first visit in this open adoption. I know how nerve-wracking it is being the birth parent, and I'm sure it's as nerve-wracking on your end of things as well. I did want to say, for me, the first time I saw my little boy after I placed was really the first time I realized how much he wasn't the same little boy that I said goodbye to in the hospital. Until then when I thought about him in my head I thought of him as the name I named him, he was the little boy I knew. But when I re-met him and realized how he was a different little boy, him having a different name didn't seem as weird to me. I have no idea if your daughter's bmom will feel the same way, but coming into a room and meeting this little girl who is very different from the one you said goodbye to, and having everyone around them calling her the new name, well she may change her practices. If she's not like me and still only can see your daughter as having this other name I would very calmly explain that your daughter recognizes her name and you think it would be confusing if people were calling her something different. I think telling her she can still talk about your daughter any way she's comfortable, but you would appreciate the bmom using her new name when speaking to her directly. I think being direct in these situations always works better, even if she's upset and needs time to process it, in the long run it will make your relationship more open and honest. Good Luck!  \n",
      "I remember at my match meeting my son's adad handed me his business card with his full name, and all work info on it including his cell number. They barely knew me, but that completely set the tone for the level of trust we have in our OA. I know where they live (we have had two visits at their apartment) and I was honestly two blocks away from their apt. having dinner last night, could have walked past their apartment to get to the subway and instead walked another way because it felt weird being in their space uninvited. I can't imagine purposefully doing drive-bys of their apartment. I can't imagine dropping by unexpected. It's such a fragile relationship and I would never do anything that could possibly break their trust in me. But if I was a person who would do that sort of thing, I'm not sure I wouldn't be able to do it whether you gave me the information or not - you really can find that sort of info on the internet. I think giving the information sets a really good foundation of trust. JMHO  \n",
      "I can say I loved the flowers I got from my son's parents, it was nice to get them with a congratulations, I felt like a normal Mom for a day or two. If you want to give more than that, I think jewelry of some sort is a nice idea. Maybe a locket would be nice, or a necklace with the child's birth stone in it, or a charm bracelet which if you're planning on an open adoption you could add to with charms that represent your child as they grow. I would also say writing got me through a lot of the first months (and even now) so a really nice journal sounds like an amazing idea.  \n",
      "When I was first talking about placing my child with the agency they also encouraged me to consider open adoption. I didn't want it, I thought it sounded messy and would make my son feel different from other kids. My SW encouraged me to do my homework and I did. I realized for most kids open adoptions would clarify things, help them complete their story and give them a better sense of identity. I chose open adoption for my son, not for me. Perhaps your agency is encouraging this because they have counseled the children who were adopted in closed adoptions, or they met the aparents who had closed the adoption and now can't find the birth families. Maybe they are trying to give you a different perspective because they honestly believe it is better for the child to have access to their whole story. I'm so thankful my SW made me consider it when I was still an emom, when I was still struggling for what was best for my son. I'm just thankful that my son's aparents and I are able to give my son the gift of knowing his full story.  \n",
      "For me our process was I whittled down families by their one page portfolio, then I chose who I wanted to meet in person by a scrapbook. So unlike you guys, the scrapbook had to speak for them. What I will say though for me it was great to see pictures of their extended family, I loved getting a sense of how many people would love this kid. I also enjoyed pictures showing them being themselves. One scrap book you could tell were a lot of pictures they took specifically for the book and it just seemed less genuine. It was good to see a little of the couple's history (wedding picture, pictures from graduation, etc), but I remember one couple showed a lot of things a child couldn't be a part of(like mountain climbing) and it seemed like a child wouldn't fit into the life they were portraying, so I suggest highlight things that you'll be able to include your child in. The emom will want to see what her child's life might be like. Every emom is different though. Everyone has different things they are looking for or might catch their eye. So show who you are and be yourself, when PAP are themselves that's what comes through the most.  \n",
      "RebeccaInORI've wondered about this for a long time. If an emom can't afford medical care, then she will qualify for medicaid, welfare, and food stamps. How can an agency say they need expenses? I have wondered if by paying expenses the agencies might even be keeping her from getting counseling or different input....I don't know, it just seems nonsensical to me. I have seen listings where agencies or facilitators want 35,000 or even more for a baby. I simply do not get it. If medicaid pays for the medical, and food stamps for food, and HUD and other programs for housing, how in the world could any expenses amount to that???? Not everyone who doesn't have insurance qualifies for medicaid. I know a lot of people who work multiple jobs, none at full time, or freelance who don't have insurance and yet don't qualify for medicaid. Even with insurance, there are still expenses. I have high deductible insurance, depending on when in my calendar year the birth fell I could have had as much as $8,000 in deductibles (luckily I fell directly in line with my insurance so I only had $5,000 (of that $2,000 were for my son and because I signed TPR at the hospital, the agency was able to have medicaid foot that portion of it). I also lost about $3000 in salary from time I took off work (and that wasn't just because I had health issues, standard practice is a woman to take 6 weeks minimum off work post birth). We live in a place without universal health care and where there is no paid maternity leave, and as a person who made $2,000 more than the limit to receive any aid, I can tell you there are many people who are not quite poor enough for anyone to really help you. I wasn't looking for a free ride or someone to pay my way, but my reality is my pregnancy and the lost wages associated made me not have enough money for rent the month after I placed. I had to borrow money from my boss at work to pay my rent, the first time in the last 13 years where that happened. I'm a functioning person with a stable job who until then paid all bills on time, it's just the extra expenses the pregnancy added almost pushed me over the edge. In the end I figured it out but wouldn't wish the stress that $3,000 caused me on anyone.  \n",
      "Honestly, I personally think having a date for a visit in place right away, even if it's in a couple weeks or a couple months would help - it gives her something to focus on. It also reconfirms you're going to hold to at least what you promised, something most bparents fear after placement - there's a big power shift that bparents feel right away. My feelings on the number of visits I wanted changed drastically from being pregnant to after placement. It wasn't because I was trying to co-parent, it was because I needed to see he was doing okay, that he was growing and happy and healthy, that he was loved. I could handle my grief if I knew his life was good, but seeing him was really the only way I could do that. My agreement was for two visits a year, I thought that would be enough, but if the first time I saw my son after he was the small little bundle in the hospital was when he was 6 months old, and standing, and crawling and had teeth and was super interactive, well I think that would have broken my heart all over again, that this boy who I cared about so much was such a different little kid from the one I knew. My guess is as he gets a little older and the change in six months isn't so drastic maybe we'll end up at our two visits per year, or maybe because we built a real foundation to our relationship we'll actually enjoy having visits more often. My son's aparents have been great about doing visits as often as our schedules align, which is about once every two months. My son sees me enough where he'll always know who I am, and I see him enough where I don't feel like a stranger. But the visits only solidified in me that he had other parents, that he was a different child than the one I knew in the hospital. The visits for me were one of the things that helped with my grieving/healing process the most. You need to do what's best for your family first, but honestly for me OA was/is such uncharted territory that I usually don't know if something is going to work (if I was ready for a visit, if I was ready to meet the extended family, if getting more pictures is better, if I prefer set updates or updates on a flexible calendar) until I try it.  \n",
      "Every hospital should have an on staff social worker who is going to be more capable of dealing with these kind of questions than any doctor or nurse. As many previously have said, getting your agency or attorney to deal with the hospital social worker will probably be the easiest for everyone involved, but I think getting the hospital social worker on board and having someone talk with him/her will be the most important step. They'll be able to work out what you need to do to have access to the child during the stay (and if the emom doesn't want to stay on the floor with the nursery, or see the child, that can happen as well), The hospital SW will also be the one who can tell you what the protocol is for discharge. Every hospital will be a little bit different. I will say prior to the birth, I hated people telling me my feelings would change or I might feel differently. Whether I thought they were right or not, part of my dealing with what I was going through was to be okay with everything until I wasn't. Being reminded it might get harder or I might feel differently definitely didn't help me. IMO, I think you should extract yourself from those conversations, have her talk to her SW or the hospital SW about the choices she has during the stay, if they are decent at their jobs they'll raise concerns about her having her time with the child, etc and you can just support whatever decision she makes.  \n",
      "In general a baby's care in the hospital is automatically put on the mother's policy, and can be on that policy for 30 days without any action on her part. With me that actually meant I owed an extra deductible on him for his two day hospital stay. Because I couldn't afford to pay that the agency I worked with retroactively applied for medicaid for him. Prior to my stay everyone assured me he would be covered under my insurance for 30 days, no one warned me that came with an additional deductible. It also meant I was charged additional rates to go to a family plan. I ended up in red tape for a few months trying to sort it all out. If her insurance is without deductible or any significant co-pays and her employer is paying for the premiums it is probably not an issue. If there are additional costs to her then you may want to investigate whether you can change what insurance the child is put onto originally, and if it can be part of your plan.  \n",
      "I don't get why you wouldn't show other people in your pictures besides just you. Is it a privacy thing? Because for me, the PAP I picked had lots of pictures with other family members, with their friends, etc. I thought it just showed them as people with a huge support system, and showed how many people would love my child, which I loved! - it's important to have enough pictures featuring you just so they know what you look like and who you are, but I see no issue with it showing other people, especially other family members. (if it's against your agency policy or if there are privacy issues, I have no idea, but just giving my opinion) I also think posing for pictures doesn't make sense. Honestly my biggest criticism of the books I looked at (I looked through six before narrowing down my couples to 1) was they looked too much a like, they all had the same tone and same sort of pictures, it was hard to get a feeling for couples being different. So maybe all PAP should stop listening to their agencies so they stand out :evilgrin: - I think standing out for things that make you guys unique is important and gives the emom more of a shot of picking a family who really fits who she is.  \n",
      "MomAt41 On another note (probably should create another thread for this, I'm sure it's a big issue for others too), what do you do with suggestions from birthmoms when it's not actually what's best for the child? Just side-step the issue and not say much, or say you're doing it differently and why, or what? This whole thread reminds me of my last visit, J was just about 7 months, and was crawling over to things and pulling himself up. He had been wearing socks but then it was clear he started slipping a little so his Dads took them off. Then later his Grandma started asking why he was barefoot and wasn't wearing socks and shoes. And his Dad said something like \"Our occupational therapist told us kids have problems feeling the floor in shoes, it will take them longer to walk.\" That sort of shut her down. I don't think an over-opinionated bmom is any different than an over-opinionated grandma, and this approach definitely worked. I think telling her why they were doing it differently at least showed her they listened to her advice but they had a different opinion, in this instance I think ignoring it would have made her feel like they weren't listening and she would have kept saying it, this way she knew they heard her, and just disagreed (and it didn't hurt that there was an expert backing them up ;)  \n",
      "It sounds like your experience was different from mine, but I had already seen the couple's \"book\" they had made with all their family pictures and information about them (that's how I chose them). So pictures would have meant less at that meeting. But if she hasn't seen any pictures of you or your family that might be a great ice breaker. I also think in general just be yourself. Even if you're nervous (I was definitely nervous, so I think both sides probably are), just make sure to be genuine. As an emom I was just looking to make sure these people were the way I was picturing from the things I'd read and the pictures I'd seen. It was an awkward meeting, we were all on edge, but we all also acknowledged that and just started to talk about our lives in general. Good Luck  \n",
      "I feel for you, I was the kid that HATED homework, I would do anything to not do it, and I drove my parents NUTS. For me it was because I found it boring and tedious. I always did well on tests, but the doing problems over and over after I already knew what I was doing was something I had no interest in, so I just didn't do it. I wasn't until I was in college where success was based a little more on what you learned and less on doing homework where I excelled. I guess what I'm trying to say is my parents yelling or punishing did very little, them offering rewards didn't do anything either, I just didn't learn the way my teachers wanted me to and didn't see a reason to compromise. Maybe having a conversation with him about why he doesn't like his homework (whether it's boring like it was for me, or it's too hard and he gets confused, or its just he would rather be playing video games). If you're able to get the why it might help you figure a way for you to help him to get through it. And my perspective isn't from a parent, it's from someone who remembers being my parents' \"disappointment\" all through my teens. And don't fret too much - I failed a quarter of physics because I didn't turn in any homework, my parents thought it was the end of the world. But I did well in college, and ended up going to an Ivy League grad school, so I think he still might find his nitch, for some kids it's just not high school.  \n",
      "My two best friends from childhood are both Doctors, one is now pregnant with her third, the other just gave birth to her second a month ago, both would have a glass of wine on occasion (maybe once a month) during their pregnancies. It is also an accepted practice in other countries, as I have friends from Taiwan and Venezuela who both found it more than acceptable to have a drink while pregnant. In fact my Doctor during my pregnancy, said when I voiced concerns about a drink I had prior to finding out I was pregnant, stated a similar idea that she felt in moderation (she told me a drink every couple weeks to once a month), she wasn't too worried about alcohol. I am not a doctor or scientist of any kind, so have no idea the medicine, nor would I personally risk it in a pregnancy, but I do understand how people might see alcohol in moderation as okay. I also want to say that as a birth mom I thought it was really important to be honest about the conditions of the pregnancy. The truth is I wanted a family who wanted my son, no matter what. I realize it might seem that a birth mom might lie to look better or to have better choices, but the reality is unless it's a very extreme case, most emoms have plenty of choice on where to place, telling that they drank a couple of times a month won't limit that choice anywhere near as much as you would think. I would say be honest with the emoms about what you're comfortable with, if you don't want alcohol put that. It's honesty on both sides that helps place the right child with the right family.  \n",
      "I don't know anything about homestudies, but I do know about choosing parents for a child, and I can tell you that I knew nothing about the finances or what the apartment of the aparents looked like when I picked them. The truth is I wanted to feel like the PAP were honest, upfront, and stable, so couples who seemed to try to appear to have more than they did, or be living above their means, I wasn't comfortable with, but it didn't matter to me what the couple had or didn't have as far as things. Every emom is different, and may be looking for different things. No one (not even an emom) can tell you what emoms as a whole are looking for because each emom I've met looked for different things. I don't think PAP should try to be someone they aren't, but rather show who you are and I believe if you do that the perfect child for your family will find you.  \n",
      "My due date stayed the same, but during my 36th week my Dr. said she'd induce the following week. Then the 37th week came and she said my blood pressure had stayed the same so we'd wait another week. In the end I wasn't induced until a week after my original due date! I would email the agency and PAP after each appointment so for them it seemed that my story was constantly changing, in reality I didn't know anything, but wanted to make sure they knew everything I knew. I also know a woman who's due date changed by a month around 30 weeks. I have no idea why the major change, but then the doctors regressed to a date between the two a couple weeks later, and finally she ended up going into labor sometime in the middle of all the dates. Just remember, it's all just a guess.  \n",
      "I just saw it yesterday and it is definitely a really hard movie to watch. For me it wasn't what you see but more how it made you feel, which was unsettled. I think the last movie I saw that made me feel that way was Requiem for Dream.  \n",
      "I hope you don't mind that I'm adding to the lists. Please realize these are just my truths, I'm a birthmother, but I don't represent every birth mother out there. 1) I love my child. period. 2) Open adoption is hard, it's not an easy ride at all. But it's worth it. 3) For me, I anxiously await pictures and updates. I realize that my son's aparents will probably forget to email me to tell me when he cuts his first tooth or takes his first step, I think they forget that the only thing I know about my son is what they tell me. 4) I listen to those PAP who are anxiously awaiting updates when they are matched with an expectant mother, and I hope they remember that feeling of not knowing. I know several birthmothers who similarly are waiting on pins and needles when their update from the aparents is late. I feel anxious from the minute I send an email until I get a response. 5) Just because I was willing to admit that I didn't have the resources to parent at this point in my life doesn't mean I'm a bad person, or lazy, or that I am living a life I'm not proud of. I ended up in an impossible situation, that's all. 6) I don't expect my son's aparents to feel guilt, I expect them to be the best parents they can be. I don't expect my son to be perfect, I love to hear about his imperfections. I don't expect my son's life to be perfect either. 7) I feel heartache and grief everyday. I don't want anyone to feel guilt about that, but I do want my son to know that no day goes by without thinking of him.  \n",
      "During my first visit I got there a little early, and almost walked out the door about five times - and then I saw everyone and it was fine. But that initial hump of what it might be like is really hard to deal with. Honestly the fact you are so understanding is pretty amazing. I think you need to acknowledge what happened because my guess is she's really embarassed and has probably gone back and forth about having a visit a hundred times but is now worried about bringing it up again as she might not be able to go through it. I don't think there's anything wrong in making sure she knows that for now (since your son is still young and probably doesn't really know what's going on) you understand if she changes her mind about a visit at any point - even the day of. That understanding may give her the confidence to try again even if she knows she might still panic. Good Luck...  \n",
      "As a birthmom getting any flowers in the hospital was nice, especially since I was on a floor with all new Moms, everyone had tons of flowers and balloons - so getting some flowers from the AP was really appreciated. As far as a card, I got a card saying something to the extent of thinking of you, and the inside they wrote they thought I was a strong and amazing person (I'm paraphrasing here). What really meant a lot during that time was feeling like a normal Mom, getting flowers and cards, getting visitors in the hospital who oohed and aahed over the baby, well it was great to feel normal. I put good thoughts towards you, I know how tough to waiting was on my end and I imagine your side of things the waiting is even worse.  \n",
      "As a birthmom, I think having a passive way to communicate can be really great. There are definitely days where I wish I had an update, where I just want to know what's going on, if I could go on a blog and read things (especially if you keep it updated regularly) in my own time I think it would really help. I have a pretty good open relationship with my son's aparents, but I would think a blog would also be good for birthmothers who aren't as comfortable with the openess, no matter how uncomfortable with contact a woman is, there will be days where she just wants to know what is going on in your lives. I know bparents who can't handle having to deal with emails from the aparents on certain days, so instead of being \"confronted\" with an update when the aparents write it, they could go to the blog on days where they are better able to deal with it.  \n",
      "So my agency as far as I know charged one fee to the aparents, and that was the amount paid for a placement, they were not expected to pay any more even if a match failed but rather just stayed on the list until they received a placement. Once the match was placed with a couple they were expected to provide an attorney for all the final paperwork. That (as far as I know) is the only additional expense. I don't know the type of counseling the emoms received at your agency, did you know if it was third party? I would hope since you were paying for it separately, that it was at least third party. For me it was through the agency. That meant although it was considered counseling, it wasn't really confidential, it was as much a fact finding mission about me, about the birth father and about my situation as anything else, most of the information went into a file that the aparents SW had access to. But at the time I didn't feel that, I only felt like I was being supported no matter the decision I made. But I would say verifying counseling is third party (the counselor is not employed by the agency) is a big thing, especially if you're paying for it. On that note, after placement I had a run in with my son's bfather that didn't go great. I needed someone to talk to and went into my SW for the post placement counseling they had promised me. When I got there I found out that she had already talked to my son's aparent's SW about the situation. I decided at that point if I needed any more counseling I'd prefer to find a neutral source. To make a long story longer, my agencies policy was to not directly pay for any expenses including medical. They also didn't pass on any expenses to the aparents. They felt this would make the emom feel obligations or coercion. Instead the way they dealt with expenses was to provide emoms access to a foundation which would give grants to emoms. Basically people donated to this foundation, and they had money they could give to emoms, but these grants were capped at $800. If my expenses were just transportation, maternity clothes and extra food it would have covered them, but given I had medical bills and missed wages, it was not enough. Since I had insurance so wasn't on medicaid, but my insurance cost a lot out of pocket, I was a unique case for them. In the end (after placement when my bills started coming in) I started making a lot of noise because of my frustration and they decided to cover my basic medical expenses, but this cost was not passed on to the aparents, it was taken from their operating costs. My lost wages were never covered and I was only told to file for disability (but not told how to do that, my Dr. was the person who walked me through it). The 30 day newborn care was a basic service, nothing extra. The truth is the caretakers did so on a volunteer basis, I believe they were given supplies of diapers, clothes, formula, etc, from the agency, and the agency had a peditrician on site that the newborns would see, but the caretakers didn't take any money for doing it. The cost for supplies was folded into the basic fee for the aparents, and every bmom was encouraged to do it for at least a few days if not more. In fact I was the first case in over a year that did a direct placement (it was a fight to get them to do a direct placement). Again, I'm not sure if they ever charge for the post placement counseling for adoptees, but I do know that my son just went in for an appointment with an occupational therapist which was free of charge, they just saw how he was developing. I guess they offer that once a year the first two years, as well as play groups and support groups. As of right now they don't offer support groups for bmoms, but I'm working really hard to change that ;) I do know my agency had one book they showed everyone, so the idea that different PAP wouldn't be shown as often depending on how much they paid I don't think is true (the one exception was special needs or high risk births). They are a non-profit agency, which is why they said they didn't pay expenses. It also means they can do fundraising, which apparently offsets adoption costs for PAP. My agency also restricted the number of PAP they accepted at any time to help keep the wait time for placement down. In the end my agency worked for me, my son has an amazing family, my medical bills (finally) were paid, and although my pregnancy did cost me some money, it is what it is and as long as my son is doing well I will deal with it. I just hate that I had to fight for some of the things I did. And even more I hate that some of the aparents coming out of my agency have NO CLUE how the agency works, they naively think bmothers have all expenses covered.  \n",
      "HopefulMom2bee Racilious- I read in one of your pp that you said pregnancy is down right expensive and that you agree that paying expenses before birth can lead to misuse of the system, but that you feel that money should go into an escrow account so if the emom places she'll have her expenses paid. But, pregnancy is always expensive whether a woman chooses to parent or chooses adoption. For the sake of argument I guess (I don't want this to sound like an attack at all I'm just truly curious) why should expenses be paid out to a woman who places when young or single women who choose to parent have zero relief (if they don't qualify for gov assistance)? If you never chose adoption, you still would have been out of work for the same amount of time and had the same expenses plus some, with the same salary. So what then? I keep coming back to this post today and trying to write a response,but work has gotten the better of me and I keep getting interrupted. But everytime I've started a response, it's been different because it's a tough question you ask, for several reasons. For me saying someone who choses to parent doesn't deserve relief isn't quite how I feel. I think our system in the US sort of sucks. The fact we have no paid maternity leave annoys me, and the state of health care is also pretty bad. I honestly wish our government supported women who make the choice to continue their pregnancy whether they parent or place, but for many, they don't. What I don't believe is that PAP should be the ones to give a mother who chooses to parent that relief. It shouldn't be their financial responsibility just because they were picked out of a book. What I do think is a birthmom should not have to suffer financially for a having a child and choosing to place the child. Honestly I've gone through a lot because I chose to place, misconceptions by outsiders, some cruel things have been said to me about my choice to place, plus I have suffered a lot of emotional pain, there is a grief that goes with placement that is more than I could have ever imagined. I would go through any and all of that ten times over because I know right now my son is happy and healthy and that's why I did it. But to lose money on top of all that, well that just seems unfair to me. I have HUGE EMPATHY for PAP who end up paying expenses for a child that they didn't get to take home, because IMO basically I had the same thing happen to me. My only point in all this is I think there needs to be reform that is fair for both sides, and I don't think having someone pay medical bills and resulting lost wages for the birth of a child they then don't parent, regardless if you're a PAP or a birthmother, seems fair. those 'bmom expenses' are often not hospital/medical expenses....but rent, utilities, car payments, food, personal items...........and that's something I have a problem with....but that's me.  I don't think those expenses should be covered either, but I do believe that lost wages should be reimbursed. I sat negotiating with my doctor during my pregnancy about how much she was asking me to cut back at work not because I wanted to work more hours but because I couldn't afford not to work (she started at working 16 days a week, I started at keeping up my 50 hours a week, we ended at 32 hours a week to her dismay). If the difference in salary was covered - even if I didn't receive the money until after I placed - I think it would have been better for both me and my son. I wouldn't have been so stressed out, I would have been able to actually follow my Dr. recommendations, and I wouldn't have had to spend 6 months digging myself out of the hold caused by my missed wages. I know lost wages was something my agency had no desire to hear anything about, but it was my reality.  \n",

      "I realize this isn't a very used thread, but I thought I would post on here anyway in hopes someone might find this. I'm a birthmother who placed my son seven months ago with a gay couple. We have an open adoption, and have had four visits and several emails and pictures have been exchanged. I know I picked an amazing couple to parent my son, but I am curious how their \"non traditional\" family might impact the way I interact with the family. I get \"well you're lucky as you'll be the only Mother your son has\" and even though that is technically true, it still doesn't make me his Mom in that sense. I'm curious if any of you are on the other side of the coin; what are your feelings of the birthmother's role in your open adoptions might be and do you think they are different than other adoptive families might be?  \n",
      "MarkandLeo, I'm sorry I never responded to your comment, I think it makes total sense that hetero couples might not be as tied to a traditional family image, but I do think same sex couples tend to not be, which honestly can be helpful. So the comment earlier about what title to go by has kept creeping back into my life. I never talked about it with my son's Dads, I don't feel too strongly one way or another, there are titles I personally don't like (tummy mommy for instance) and titles I don't think fit my situation (other mother or first mother), but birth mother is fine with me, and just calling me his Mom (or mother) would be fine as well. But what I'm finding weird is they (my son's parents) seem to be evading ever saying any title for me. Like this weekend I met a lot of new people and I wasn't introduced to any of them, they never said, this is J's Mom or Bmom or whatever, they just didn't say anything. It was awkward at points, like who is this person. So now I'm wondering if their insecurity about what to call me is keeping them from calling me anything, and I have no idea what way they are leaning, are they wanting to call me his mom with no qualifier but think that's overstepping, or do they want to call me his birth mother but feel weird about it? I feel like in more traditional families the conversation is more about what qualifier to use, but with this there's an added dimension since there isn't another mother maybe having a qualifier seems weird, but not having one seems like it would be weird too. Or maybe I'm completely overthinking this. Okay, I admit I'm pretty likely overthinking this. :o  \n",
      "I saw your thread before, but I didn't reply because I was still waiting and not sure how things might be. My situation is a little different in that it's semi-open (just letters and pics - by their choice). My son's b-dad was very involved, and I like that there is a dad, since there's not in our family. My son is far too little to understand, but when I talk to him about his bithparents I call them his birthmommy and birthdaddy or by their names. On thing I have struggled with is all the people in my life who ask about (or occasionally make assumptions about) his birth family. I want to protect their (and his) privacy, but I don't want him to feel like his story needs to be secret. It surprised me how protective I came to feel of his birthparents - and believe me, they absolutely do not need my protection, they are very strong and capable people. I wonder if your son's dads could be trying to negotiate some of that as well. I tend to be a big fan of direct communication. I'm not sure what your relationship is like with his dads, but could you address it directly with them by saying something like \"this situation was weird for me and I wondered what was up?\" If they are struggling with something, it could be a relief for them if you open up the conversation. I completely understand what you mean about protecting them, I definitely have felt that from my son's parents. And especially in person I think they do worry that people will overwhelm me, or that I won't want to talk about something and people will ask questions. That could have a lot to do with it. I am planning to talk to them about it at the next visit, just trying to figure out in my own head how I was feeling...Mostly I don't care how they refer to me, I just want there to be a consistency between how I refer to myself with their family and how they refer to me when I'm not there. I'm so glad you replied on this thread, it's been great to hear from everyone's perspective (both PAP and AP). I have also been thinking about this, especially about calling the birthmom, mom. The only issue I have with that is that people have an image of a mom and I think a birthmom can't fulfill that image. I feel that it puts unnecessary pressure on the bmom because the relationship is different. And, I think it might create expectations in the child, especially when they are elementary school age, since they don't have abstract thinking. They might compare their mom with other kids' moms and realize that their mom isn't there all the time, or things like that. Whereas when there is a different term, it's easier for the child to understand that their situation is just different. Instead of a mom, they have another dad, and then additionally they have (... birthmom or whatever term...) I completely get where this comes from. The question then becomes when a child is in a classroom and they are making Mother's Day gifts (for instance) is it better for them to have a person who has that title (even if they don't fill the everyday role of a Mom) so they don't feel left out, or is it better since they don't have someone to fill that role that they also don't have someone that fills that title? I don't know if there is a right answer to this, just curious your thoughts. On the other had, I really like the term birthmom. I understand that people might see it similar as tummy mommy, like she \"just\" gave birth to you. But as a gay couple that can't give birth, we see this as something VERY special that we are not able to do for our child. She is your BIRTHMOM!!! So I think I would prefer our child to call their birthmom by her name, or a nickname (kids come up with stuff and save you the work sometimes) and then explain to them that Sarah or Anna or whatever her name is is also his/her birthmom. I'm sure there are also good books that explain how special the birthmom is and what an important role she plays in the child's life.  I get this as well. I think since first mom and other mother didn't seem to fit my circumstances AT ALL, I also felt comfortable with birth mom. Secretly I sort of also liked bio mom a lot - but that is only because I think it sounds like a super hero, and I always wanted to be a super hero. :o  \n",
      "I had a visit with my son this weekend, he calls both his Dads \"Daddy\". I asked them if it was ever hard to differentiate who he's talking about (he is still a toddler and not always the most verbally clear), and they said they figure it out. I think that's just true, you figure it out, people can have the same name if that's what a child calls them. I think in the case of grandparents it's even less of a worry, you just refer to them as Nana (last name) when they aren't around or both sets are around and Nana when just one set is around.  \n",
      "Well my son is definitely getting to know me by my first name but I'm not sure how they are talking about our relationship with him. I know he's starting to try to figure out why he has two daddies and other people have a Mommy. I don't know if they have started trying to explain any of that and my relationship to him, but I know it's coming soon. I have been thinking of trying to talk to them about it, if nothing else so I won't say the wrong thing on one of our visits, but I haven't broached that subject yet. \n",

      "I feel incredibly guilty just needing to even write this, but I am really struggling & feel on the verge of tears all day long. I don't really think it is any 1 thing, but rather everything compounded together & I feel like I am drowning here. We have 4 bio boys (19, 17, 14, & 10) and we have an adopted daughter from Guatemala (2) who we brought home when she was 5 months old. I had no problem bonding immediately with my Guate daughter & so I have been completely blindsided by my feelings this time. We brought home our soon to be adopted daughter, M, from foster care about 2 mo. ago. She is 3.5. It's a long story how we were matched with her & I know that it was a miracle & she is supposed to be our daughter, but right now, I spend most of my time feeling annoyed with her...and that makes me feel horrible! We were told that she was completely healthy & developmentally on target...they even \"warned\" us not to ask for very much as a subsidy because we would not be having extra dr. visits or therapy appts. Well, even during our visit month, with just spending a couple of hours a week with her, I could tell she had asthma. She was finally diagnosed last week & we now have to do breathing treatments 2x a day, plus she seems to be sick quite often for a 3.5 year old (which I'm sure is a result of the asthma). I also noticed an oddity in her walking/running which we have now been referred to a specialist for. So, for our \"completely healthy\" child, I have spent hours on the phone arranging medical appts. & was at the dr. 3x in one week (& all of it has been for \"pre-existing\" conditions). She has also disclosed a few things to us about stuff that happened at her foster home which I have had to fight with CSB to get her into therapy for. The FM was extremely rude & nasty to me & completely uncooperative about the entire transition, which made our visit month very stressful. Since then, I have had to defend myself over & over to her SW (who I strongly believe is against our adoption because we are white) about so many things while at the same time she sings the praises of her former FM (who I have been told should no longer be fostering because she is so horrible). M really is a pretty normal 3.5 year old, but I am finding her behaviors very irritating & it's hard for me to bond with her. She talks incessantly & interrupts all the time if I'm trying to hold a conversation with anyone but her, she is very bossy with my 2 y.o. & expects her to share everything but yet if I tell her she needs to share something she immediately cries (the FM sent almost nothing with her that could be considered her own so everything they play with is our Guate daughter's except for some things that we have bought her - but we can't afford to stock a whole toybox for her at this point). She refuses to nap because she won't sleep when it is light outside or if other people are up unless she just completely passes out. She is going to bed at 10-10:30 at night & getting herself up at 7 (we have now started to make her go back to her bed & she doesn't seem to be terribly upset about it, so I hope that will help a bit because she is missing about 3-4 hours of sleep per day for her age). I feel very smothered right now. Even my boys are starting to get irritated by her constant crying over little stuff & I often will hear \"stop crying\". The things that I really expected - temper tantrums, night crying, crying a lot for the FM - none of that has happened at all. But I am having a hard time dealing with the manipulative behaviors that I'm sure she learned at the FM's house to get attention or get her way. I feel so guilty for the way I feel about stuff, but I am overwhelmed right now with the physical & emotional issues that she came with added to the total non-support of the SW's and the normal 3 y.o. irritating behaviors that they all have. If we just would have had some preparation mentally that we were going to be dealing with a lot of illness, etc. then I don't think it would be so bad. I'm also very tired & I miss spending time with my 2 y.o. & we are now trying to catch up with our schooling that we have fallen way behind on (I homeschool). Also added to this is that my son who has special needs has really been acting out a lot lately & I think it's just the transition (he doesn't handle transition well - good or bad). I don't know who to talk to about it because no one really understands & because I'm totally embarrassed to even feel this way. I'm just not sure where to turn & I just really need some encouragement that we will eventually turn a corner & things will get better & I will \"feel\" love for her at some point. Thanks, Beth DS S-19 DS J-17 DS J-14 DS E-10 AD E-2 Guate Soon to be AD M-3  \n",
      "Thank you so much everyone!! It honestly never occurred to me that these could be attachment related behaviors. I always imagined the attachment challenged kids to be throwing tantrums, not making eye contact, refusing affection, refusing to go to sleep at night, etc....but after your advice, I went to a couple of attachment websites (Nancy Thomas & a4everfamily) & sure enough - my daughter fits about 5 or 6 of the classic signs of attachment issues. I ordered the book \"When Love is Not Enough\" and will talk to her therapist at our appt. in May (we couldn't get in until then) to see if she can advise us on attachment & I'm also going to e-mail a4everfamily & see if I can get some specific suggestions right now. Again, thank you so much...not just for understanding & making me realize I am not alone (which was invaluable to me!!!), but also for opening my eyes to the real cause of her behaviors.

      "It may depend more on the gender of the sibs, but I can give you my personal experience. My brothers are 5 and 12 years older than me. I am not close at all with the oldest one, even though I worshipped him when I was little. I am not very close to my next brother either, but he's just not a really talkative type person, so maybe that's why. I don't have a \"bad\" relationship with either of them...just not particularly close. With my sons, my oldest 2 (21 months apart) have always been the best of friends. The ones who are 4-9 years younger are not. Part of that may be that my 14 y.o. has special needs & behavior issues that affect his relationships. Maybe my boys will be closer as they are adults and age doesn't make such a difference. There is a huge difference between a 10 year old and a 17 year old. Then again, we tried adopting a 3 year old foster girl who we were hoping would be very close to our 2 year old (they are 15 mths. apart) and the 3 y.o. has such severe cognitive & behavioral SN (all undisclosed at the time of matching), not to mention the basic overbearing personality that she has, & the 2 girls never would have had the kind of relationship I had hoped they would. I guess you just never know. One benefit of fostering before adopting (we were straight adoption & are now disrupting) is that you will get the chance to see if your kids get along and you can get a feel for how their relationship is before making a permanent commitment. Good luck!  \n",
      "she's leaving? We have told CSB that they need to move M by July 30th. The adoption worker called me Thursday to let me know that they would \"hopefully\" be looking at homestudies this next week to match a family and then have a presentation. They have also told me that it will now probably be very difficult to find a family to adopt her because of all of her SN (all of which have been diagnosed since she came to us 4 months ago). She also told me that they wanted to get a large enough pool of homestudies to go through to be fair to M....my personal opinion is that it doesn't matter if the family is #1 of 10 or #1 of 2 if they're a good match, they're a good match. So, I know that she will be leaving by the end of the month. She may have to go back into foster care (she was in pre-adoptive placement with us & is not technically a \"foster\" child anymore but an \"adoptive\" child), but I think they're trying to avoid that (and I would certainly hope that they would never send her back to the horrible foster home she was in before she came to us, but I suppose they might). I'm just thinking that even if they match a family early this week & do a presentation later this same week, there will still only be a couple of weeks for a transition...so not much time...and for them to move that quickly would be a miracle! She will be 4 in Sept. Knowing that she is leaving, should we start to drop subtle hints? (I did tell her the other day that she was allowed to play with a backpack that is my daughter's while she was here; she didn't even notice that I said that) I know with her cognitive delays, sooooo much goes right over her head. I did like the idea of making up a story to explain the move, but I'm not even sure she'd \"get it\". I also don't want to make it seem like she's a bad kid or too much trouble and that's why she's moving. Should I wait until a family has been found to say anything at all? Or should we start to subtly talk about \"if\" she moved or something.....I just don't know what to do. And the way the transition to us was handled was atrocious, so I don't want to do that to her again. Should we wait until after she meets the new family? But that could be just a week or so before she moves possibly.... Sorry this is sort of rambling...I'm just thinking so many different scenarios in my head that it's hard to figure out what to do....and there are just so many \"unkowns\" right now... Thanks so much for any advice :thanks:  \n",
      "Even when things seem \"perfect\", a match can fall apart... as in our case... I do think we would have said no had they listed any of the SN M has, but none were diagnosed when we got her in Feb. Even on paper, though, M's needs can \"sound\" manageable or like \"in a different family things would be better\" or when you look at her she looks so cute, but the truth is in our case, the reality of her SN is only going to get harder to handle as she gets older and with 5 other kids (& mine are not even as young as yours) I can't handle them. I also would be very wary of a child older than yours, esp. a boy older than your girls. They thought that M would transition to our home well because we have a 2 y.o. (& that was probably true as she was used to a lot of children being around) and she didn't even have any documented behavior issues, but our house is like a war zone most days. If our daughter did not have such a sweet personality, she would have beat the tar out of M. M is very controlling & jealous, she frequently tantrums when she has to share but yet expects everyone, esp. our 2 y.o., to share everything with her. She sat on the steps yesterday screaming & kicking the wall for an hour because my daughter picked up a doll that M had put down. I was lamenting to a friend the other day that I fear we have ruined E as my sweet, good natured little girl is turning into a nasty, demanding child. She said that's probably because she is in \"defense mode\" from the time she gets up in the morning until she goes to bed....and it's true, the only time E is really relaxed & happy anymore is when M is in bed at night or gone. We also suspect sexual abuse from a former foster brother & so we are on constant alert whenever the girls are too quiet or in a small space together. They can't bathe together or be in the same room when E is getting her diaper changed. It's very stressful. There are a lot of things to think about when adopting from foster care & out of birth order, esp. opposite genders...things that never would have crossed my mind until I have lived them these last 4 months. If this boy has documented serious issues (& I would ask to see the documentation to really know for sure), I would take it as a blessing that you found out before he was placed in your home. There will be a child out there for you & your family and I know how exciting it is to be matched...that excitement caused me to talk myself out of a lot of things that just didn't seem right because I kept thinking how perfect this seemed. I wish I had listened to my instincts and it would have saved me & my entire family months of stress & problems. I hope your forever son finds his way to you soon.  \n",
      "It's a long story how we've gotten to this point, but we have now told CSB that they need to find a new family for M. Her SN are just so much more than we can handle. She was presented to us as completely healthy & developmentally on target which is so far off I can't believe she was in foster care for almost 3 years. Back when we were matched, there were a bunch of families in the running. Of course, this was for a healthy child, so I'm not sure if any of those families are still interested. Today, I had a meeting with M's SW. She asked me what we were thinking as far as moving her. To be brutally honest (which I didn't tell her), I am so physically & emotionally drained from the stress of caring for her that I am going to need quite awhile to \"heal\" at this point &, as much as we love her, the sooner they can move her the better for our entire family. I had told them that we wanted to help in the transition to the new family because we got no help whatsoever from the previous FM. I'm beginning to think that they took this to mean we are fine with keeping her for as long as it takes to find a family, even if that is months & months. At one point, the SW told me that she didn't even know if they could find a family who would take a child with her SN & that they could always move her back into foster care if we wanted her moved before they could find a family. Then it makes it seem like we just don't care what they do with her as long as she is out of our house, which is not true. We had kind of had in our minds July 30th as a date to at least be transitioning. She needs to start in a SN preschool this fall & we think it's best that her new family gets her set up in that from the beginning. But they couldn't even get a preliminary meeting with the supervisors to discuss her case until July 2nd, so I'm figuring there's no way they'll have chosen a new family & be transitioning her by then. I also homeschool & we fell so far behind this spring after she moved in that I have got to really concentrate on the boys' schooling & lesson plans. I usually take a couple of weeks in August to get that together. I don't know how that will happen if she's still here. So, what do you all think is a reasonable timeframe to give them to move her? And what if they can't find a family??? I know it's not ideal for her to go back into fostercare, but what if they're taking months & months to decide? Also, do you think they would move her back with the former FM even though there were allegations of abuse & the therapist hotlined the FM for a situation that happened during our visit month & we suspect the foster brother was abusing her, and this is the same woman who never got her any help for the multiple SN she has? My friend says it's still a very real possibilty they'd put her back there. This whole situation is just so hard for all of us & I don't want to make it worse, but I feel like they are going to end up taking advantage of the fact that we are willing to bend over backwards to help this child. Thanks for any advice you can give!  \n",
      "Thank you for your replies! This has probably been one of the hardest things we've ever done (taking care of her & making the decision to disrupt). My dh has decided that he will tell them our date to have her moved. The SWs have a way of \"guilting\" me into saying we'll keep her as long as it takes when I know full well that this is not in anyone's best interest (except for the SWs who now have more paperwork to do - which if they would have paid more attention to the sub-standard foster home they had her in & made the FM get some help for her in the first place, they could have avoided all of this mess for all of us). He won't let them pressure him like they do me. I have really appreciated all of the wisdom that I've been able to glean from you who have \"been there done that\". I will probably still have more questions as we get closer to moving her on. :thanks:  \n",
      "I have blond hair & my dh has dark hair, but we are both white as can be & so are our 4 bio boys. We have an adopted 2 y.o. girl from Guatemala with pitch black hair, black eyes, & medium skin. She has a ton of long hair, but it is just like mine - very soft & fine so I knew how to do hers. We are in process right now to adopt a 3 y.o. AA girl from foster care. She has been home with us for almost 3 mo. now & we can finalize in Sept. We get a lot of stares when we are out. The biggest thing you need to know is that the AA community takes great pride in how the little girls have their hair done. The FM was AA & had done our daughter's hair in cornrows so tight that it broke a lot of her hair off. If I had done that, you can be sure I would have heard about it all the time. Right now, M's hair is growing in nicely & she's only been here a short time. I was told to let her hair \"rest\" & not do anything with it for a few days except comb it out & moisturize it. I did that. When I took her out & she had a very nice headband in, etc. I still had an AA lady come up & give me a card for her hair salon because she thought M's hair looked matted. I told her that it was not matted at all & that we were letting it rest after the maltreatment from the FM's house. She totally understood & went on to say that she thought it looked very moisturized, etc. I wasn't offended because I know that when I am out, AA women will feel they have the right to come tell me how to do her hair because they don't know that I have many AA friends who help me & that I have done tons of research on it & that I have joined an adoption skin/hair care yahoo group. I have never gone out in public with her hair \"undone\" again (even though I thought it looked really cute). The best advice I can give you is to join the adoption skincare/haircare yahoo group. I don't know the actual name of it, although I think that's it. They have tons of info on shampoos, styles, etc. plus lots of pictures. It has been a wealth of info for me. I now feel very confident when I go out because I know my DD's hair looks good. I had my friend who is a hair stylist get me all the hair products I would need. My favorites are: Redken's All Soft shampoo & conditioner for dry/brittle hair (I only wash it every other week. I soap it twice & rinse it well with fresh water between & then condition it) I also have a leave in conditioner by Redken, too. For styling, I use Biosilk Silk Therapy every day to moisturize & then Paul Mitchell Foaming Pommade when we are going out as it makes her hair look \"finished\". Every few nights, I put on KeraCare Dry & Itchy Scalp Glossifier or Mizani H2O Intense. Ok, gotta go get fingerprinted for an expiring homestudy so I gotta cut this off. If I think of anything else, I will write more later. Good Luck!  \n",
      "We have made the heartbreaking decision to disrupt the planned adoption of M. I knew from the first time I met her that things were just not \"right\", but it has taken almost 4 months to get assessments done. We told our private agency SW tonight & will be telling CSB this week. I just had a couple of questions for those of you who have made the decision to move a child from your home (foster or adoptive): If the reason was for behavioral or special needs reasons, did you have to have documentation supporting your concerns? (So far, the doctors have confirmed every one of my suspicions about her, but I don't have full documentation yet; the pediatrician is waiting to write her report until the report from the specialist comes in which could take a few more weeks) Did you give CSB a timeframe to work with? (We really think moving her by the end of July would be best so that I am able to actually work on my homeschool plans for the rest of my children & so her new family can get her set up in her Special Needs Preschool for the fall; but I'm thinking there may be no way for them to find another adoptive home- she is not a \"foster\" child, she is an \"adoptive\" child, esp. one that will take a child with her SN, so we can start transitioning her by that time; even if we are not fully done with the transition, I want to be started with it, at least. We just can't continue for 4 or 5 more months) Any tips from a BTDT would be great on how to handle the transition, how to talk to the SW, whatever advice you have. This was an incredibly hard decision to come to, but we know it is what's best for our family & for her. None of her SN were diagnosed before she came here in late Feb., even though she had been in foster care for almost 3 years, so we have been through quite a lot these last few months. She just really needs a smaller family who can really invest a lot of time & energy into helping her succeed. Thanks for any help you can give. :thanks:  \n",
      "We have friends who just finalized their adoption about a month ago. They had all 3 boys for almost 2 years (maybe the 2 older boys longer than that even). They changed all of their names completely. They are 2, 3 (almost 4), & 5. The older boys wanted their names changed & even the 2 year old began responding to his new name in just a couple of days. I think everyone has been very positive about it so far. It is difficult to remember to call them by the new names sometimes just because I'm used to calling them the old name, but it doesn't take too long to change over in your mind. We were going to change our daughter's name had we finalized the adoption....mainly because her name is so odd that I am always getting weird looks like \"how could you name her that?\" (I think esp. because I am Caucasian & she is AA & they think I did it to be really different or something, esp. when they hear all 4 of her names). Hope that helps :-)  \n",
      "I still cry sometimes over the loss of our foster baby who has been gone over 2 years. We really felt like she was our daughter. We brought her home from the hospital & then had to hand her over to relatives who had lied throughout the homestudy process when she was 3 mo. old. We were devastated. I know that she was not well taken care of because I got a notice that she missed a dr. appt. (which I had not even set up, the relative did & then didn't show) & the CASA showed up at my door about a month after her placement there saying that he had serious trust issues with the relative & was going before the magistrate. I never heard another word & all the SW would tell me is \"XXXX will be remaining in the care of relatives\"...that's it. I still have her homecoming outfit & special cards, pictures saved in a box. It doesn't help that we are now struggling with medical & attachment issues with our new placement who is straight adoption from FC, but I have to believe that God has a plan. It's really hard...

      "I am going through this right now. Our 3 y.o. has been here for a little over 2 months & I'm finding myself really \"missing\" my other kids, esp. my 2 y.o. (even though I'm still home with her all day). We just don't have that 1 on 1 time anymore. I did get advice from my post adoption depression group & they said to make sure I still spend time with my other kids without our new daughter. It sounds mean, but it is really necessary for everyone's sanity & well-being. I did have my dh put M to bed a little early the other night & I stayed up with my 5 other kids & watched a movie. Even though I feel guilty saying that, it was so relaxing & I realized how much I needed to spend time with them without M in our faces trying to divert all attention to herself.  \n",
      "Hi, I have a quick question about something that really bothers me about our daughter's SW. Whenever she comes to see us, she gives my daughter a huge, \"very\" extended hug & says over & over again \"this is my baby...I love her so much...XXX is my baby\" She does this all the while looking straight at me. I literally feel sick to my stomach during this exchange but cannot put my finger on why exactly. I do have a feeling that she is against her placement with us because we are white (daughter is AA & so is SW & so was former FM). She has been outright hostile toward me in front of my daughter & when I complained about it, she changed her tune the next time, but I could still tell she has issues with us (way too much stuff to get into here, but I am documenting it & will turn it in to her supervisor & the CSB director after we finalize). I did talk to my friend (who used to work at CSB) about this particular thing & she said that it is totally against what a SW is supposed to do & that all SW's are trained never to call a child \"theirs\". Which is actually very true as I think about it now, because our daughter is having attachment issues & while I am trying to get her to attach to me as \"my\" daughter, the SW is coming in & telling her that she is \"her\" daughter. So, should I say something to the SW (who I know will be very offended & probably lecture me on child development again about which I seem to know more than her based on things she's \"instructed\" me about so far) or should I complain to someone higher up again, or should I just try to wait it out since we will hopefully be finalizing in Sept. & then she will be out of our lives for good (oh, how I can't wait for that!)? Do any of you have experience with this type of situation? Thanks so much! Blessings, Beth BS S-19 BS J-17 BS J-14 BS E-10 AD E-2 Guatemala Soon to be AD M-3  \n",
      "Well, it is 30 days today since her visit & I haven't heard 1 word from her, even though I have called 2x & e-mailed 1x (concerning possible abuse at the FM's home & to see if she was able to get our daughter's bike from the FM). While I do understand the \"protectiveness\" that SWs feel toward the children, I do think it is wrong for her to come in to a child who is already experiencing attachment issues & is confused about whose child she really is, & call her \"MY\" baby. Esp. after SW had no problem telling my daughter to her face that her hair was so scary she was afraid of it (when she showed up an hour early on a Monday morning for a visit). This is not someone who just comes in & says \"hi, baby, how are you doing?\" or \"how's my girl?\" or whatever...this is someone who holds onto my daughter like she's rescuing her from drowing & says over & over \"this is MY baby...she's MY baby...I love her...I hope you realize this is MY baby...\" all the while looking at me over my daughter's shoulder with a cold look in her eyes. No matter how she feels about my daughter, the way she is going about it is inappropriate. I think if I felt like she was being genuine & not just trying to \"prove\" something to me that I would not mind so much, but this is a CW who spent 45 min. being nasty to me in my own home because she thought since my daughter's hair wasn't done an hour before her scheduled visit that I am apparently racist & can't love a black child & will never treat her the same as my other kids. Trust me, she was very ugly (the SW, not my daughter :-) )...and did all this in front of my daughter. So, if she were respectful to me at all & if I really felt like she cared for my daughter, I guess I would not mind it so much. But at this point, all she does is tell me the things I'm doing wrong (like explaining to M that I am her forever Mommy & the FM was her \"foster\" mom who took care of her until she could come to us - which M has fully demonstrated that she understands, but the SW said I should not try to explain anything to her because she's too young), but will not return phone calls/e-mails, will not get pictures of my daughter's first 3.5 years of life from the FM, will not get toys that my daughter specifically asks for from the FM, etc. I'd just like to see a little action behind the words....it would mean a lot more.

      "Yash - Good idea on the Yes & No answers :-) I think I'll try that next time! Thankfully, I have a great SW from our private agency who has been my lifeline. Otherwise, CSB would have made this a complete nightmare....and yet, they are always saying how they need adoptive parents...They might attract more if they would be a little supportive of those parents instead of fighting them as they are trying to help the children....sigh....

      "We are adopting from FC without fostering. Our story is really quite a miracle & like another poster said \"what God has for you it is for you\". We had a private homestudy & were also in the process to adopt from Ethiopia when we found out right after Thanksgiving that our facilitator in country was dishonest & our agency's program shut down. Because I knew that our private domestic HS was good, I started looking online for private or public domestic situations. I finally had a friend make contact at our CSB because she used to work there. It's a long story how it worked out, but within 3 weeks of finding out our ET adoption was not going to happen, we were totally matched with a 3 y.o. from foster care. We met her in January & she came home on Feb. 29th. I have been told by several people that this is a complete miracle & \"never\" happens, but God had bigger plans. The biggest problem I have right now is dealing with CSB. They have been way less than helpful & have renewed in our minds the reasons why we said we would never work with them again (we lost a fd about 2 years ago to relatives who were marginal at best; a very sad situation). So, it is true that there is no way she will be RU, I am still at the mercy of CSB for everything (w/o benefit of the larger FP stipend). We were told that she was totally healthy with no medical or developmental needs, but since she has been with us, she has been diagnosed with asthma, disclosed some possible abuse from the FM's house that we are getting ready to go to therapy for, & we are waiting for our specialist appt. at the end of May to find out if there is a medical reason why she falls down & is sometimes shaky when walking. So, even if they say that a child is perfectly healthy, I would totally expect some issues. And then you must work through CSB to resolve those issues. I tried to take care of 1 little thing on my own (a mistake on an insurance card) & was told that I can't do that - I must go through them for everything. It wouldn't be so bad except that I feel like I'm having to convince them that my daughter needs help (because all they know from the FM is that she is totally fine). So, in a nutshell - yes, it can be done & it \"can\" be done for your age group, but is very rare without the child/ren having some diagnosed SN (& then there are possibly more that are undiagnosed), and you will still have to deal with SW's (we have 4 people involved in following up with our family - it's overkill & very intrusive) & essentially following \"fostering rules\" until the adoption is finalized. But - I am living proof that it can be done. :-) (& we can't wait until Sept. when CSB's part is over!!!) Blessings, Beth DS S-19 DS J-17 DS J-14 DS E-10 AD E-2 Guatemala Soon to be AD M-3  \n",
      "I think what you're experiencing is normal. Personally, I feel it is a lot easier to bond with a baby. I am going through this myself a little bit right now, too, & I feel so guilty. My daughter from Guatemala came home at 5 months old & I felt an immediate bond with her. Our new daughter from foster care is great - she's a generally good kid with very few behavior issues, etc. - but at 3 years old, it feels harder for me to bond with her. I do love her & I know that the bond will get stronger with time (she's only been home for a month now), but it is hard sometimes when kids come to you with value systems & behaviors that are \"harder to love\". Babies are just babies...unless you get a colicky one & then I suppose it feels difficult to \"feel\" love all the time. ;-) I think it will get better for you (& for me). It has not been that long for you to have her & you are dealing with a child who's been through a lot, so it can be tough to \"feel\" bonded. But I always remind myself that love is not a feeling, it's a choice, that sometimes results in warm, fuzzy feelings, but not all the time. And I know once the newness of the situation wears off a bit, it will help me, & probably you, too. I do think it's normal though, to feel bonded to an infant more quickly. Give it some more time, and definitely find a friend to talk to - that has been my saving grace when I feel too irritated by her behaviors & need to vent so I can go back to her fresh. You could use your dh for that, but I've found that mine wants to \"fix\" the situation when I really just need to talk about it to sort out my feelings. Thanks for writing this. I had been feeling so guilty that it's taking me longer to bond with our new daughter. It's nice to know that I'm not the only one.

      "For our situation with our former foster daughter, we were told that once she was removed from our home, they would no longer tell me anything about her. The SW (who was horrible) said I could write to him & he would at least tell me if she was doing well (which I knew she wasn't because her CASA showed up at my door after she was missing dr. appts., among other things - she was 3 mo. old). Well, I wrote to him & he ignored me. I wrote him again & all he said was that she would be remaining with the relatives. So, for our fostering case, they wouldn't tell us anything after she was gone. And I believe because of privacy issues, our county will not give any information to former FPs unless those same children are coming back into the system. Our newest daughter, who we are doing a straight fostercare adoption with, had a fp with a known reputation for being \"difficult\" (I am being exceptionally nice here). The SW's were continually encouraging me to be nice to her & reach out to her during our month of visits with our new daughter, which I did, but she just blew me off or at worst was downright rude & passive agressive. The SW's also kept encouraging me to continue to have visits with her after the placement because another family had promised they would do visits with her, but didn't. I kept saying that we would send pics & letters, but would not promise visits. We had gone into this planning to do lots of visits & have her over for family functions, etc., but after meeting her & interacting with her, there is no way. Our new daughter is making a great transition & never asks about her former FM or says she misses her (which I know she can verbalize as she did tell me that during one of our first hourly visits). The animosity shown toward me from the FM would be highly detrimental to my bond as Mom to my daughter. I can also clearly see why the other adoptive family did not keep up visits with her. I would evaluate if on-going contact is going to be a blessing or a curse. It doesn't sound good so far. And, legally, you are under no obligation to continue contact if you don't want to, esp. after the adoption is finalized. Also, if your son does not seem bonded to them (or FM in particular), I would not keep putting him in the situation where he has to see her as I'm sure it brings up lots of feelings & may be causing some behavior issues in itself.

      "Hi everyone, We now have placement of our soon-to-be-adopted daughter. She has been with us for 2.5 weeks & things are going very well....not perfect, but very well. Yesterday, we had our first home visit with my daughter's SW. I will spare you the ugly details, of which there are many, but suffice it to say that she was very condescending & negative toward me the entire visit. Most of it stemmed from the fact that I hadn't done her hair yet that morning (it's a long story). I had everything out, ready to go, but the SW was an hour early without warning, so I didn't get it done. (to clarify - we are a white family adopting an AA girl & the SW is AA) I have spent hours researching how to do her hair, joined a support group for just my situation, and talked extensively to my AA friends. I don't have much hands-on experience, but I have learned a lot. (Later that afternoon, when I took her to the dr., the clerk at the lab commented on how great her hair was & was pleasantly surprised to find out I had done it myself. She was very supportive) However, any time I tried to explain myself to the SW or give her an answer to her demanding questions, she cut me off. She also made negative comments about her hair TO my daughter. There are other things I'm concerned about, such as her quick dismissal of anything she sees as alluding to improper care at the FM's house (that's a whole other story), which is such a disservice to my daughter as I do think some things went on there. And also the fact that she was asking my daughter leading questions about her sleeping situation & when she answered in a way that essentially shot the SW's theory down, the SW asked her the question again, but this time in a surprised voice like she couldn't believe it. There were other little jibes at me throughout our visit, but those were the most glaring. I have been told that it would be best to approach her about it first, instead of going straight to her supervisor. I am planning to do so via e-mail so that #1 I have a written record of what I said & any replies and #2 I can think everything out so it comes across in a non-confrontational way (esp. since I have to work with this person for another 5 months till we can finalize). I have documented everything in detail for future reference & to send to the supervisor if necessary. Does anyone have any experience with this? If so, how did you handle it? Any advice on things to say or stay away from in my e-mail? Thanks so much! :thanks: Beth BS S-19 BS J-17 BS J-14 BS E-9 AD E-2 (Guatemala) Soon to be AD M-3  \n",
      "Thank you to everyone! I have taken your responses to heart & will, for 1 thing, make sure she is looking great for her next visit several hours before the SW is due! Our situation is a little different in that our adoption is actually monitored mostly by a private agency. Our HS is through them & so they agreed to contract with CSB for this adoption. I am so thankful, as this entire thing would have been a nightmare if I was dependent on the CSB SW's for support & information. Last night our private agency SW came over. She is so supportive & I was able to give her the documentation of my visit with the CSB SW. She will be putting some of the remarks in her report which will go to CSB & to that SW. She suggested that I wait to see if she is still nasty during our next visit in a few weeks because then it will be a pattern of disrespect (among other things) on her part. She even offered to go to the head of our CSB here on our behalf if it gets really ugly. I don't look for it to get any better, but at least I can prepare myself ahead of time instead of being blindsided like I was. Thanks again!

      "I'm not sure if this is the right forum to ask this in, but my questions have to do with my new daughter who came home last Friday from foster care. She is 3 y.o. & we had visitation throughout the month of Feb. We can finalize the adoption in Sept. A couple of things have come up that I'm not sure how to handle or if they are common issues or not, but thought maybe you all might be able to give some advice. Just to give you a little insight - she is developmentally on target with no behavior issues & was with her FM for 2.5 years (minus a month living with an aunt last summer). The first is sleeping. She is a great sleeper actually as far as falling asleep. The FM said she wakes up every night with nightmares, but she has never done that here. She also said M would have trouble falling asleep & that she was often awake stirring in her room when the FM went to bed. I did find out that she had a tv in her room so I'm suspecting she had that on & just stayed up watching tv. She always lays right down & falls asleep easily here. I have been sleeping on a crib mattress next to her bed as she is alone in the room for now (our Guate daughter sleeps with us). Last night was the first night I slept back in my own bed. So, my issue is that once she realized that I was up in the morning, she would wake herself up, even if she was still exhausted. She goes to bed around 10, which is fine for us, but she has been getting herself up around 8:30 & is still very tired (she doesn't nap). Two days ago, my Guate daughter came up at 8:30 am (she goes to bed around 11 & gets up around 10 usually) & I decided to go back downstairs with her. As we were walking out of the room, she made a loud comment about her sister still sleeping. As soon as M heard her, she bolted up in bed, eyes still closed, & tried frantically to wake herself up enough to get up. I waited as she stumbled, literally, out of bed & I carried her downstairs with us. Both of them being up too early resulted in MANY tears, fights, etc. ALL DAY long! It was not good. This morning, the first morning I haven't been up in her room with her, M got up at 7:30, after she went to bed last night after 11 (Mommy had a night out & apparently they had to wait for me to get home before they could eat a snack & get ready for bed). She has now been extremely touchy & grumpy this morning. I am sure this is probably just a phase during the transition time, but if any of you have some advice as to how to get her to stay in her bed & sleep longer in the morning that would be awesome. I have a feeling the FM threatened her (& possibly more) if she got out of bed as when she first came to us, she was playing at putting a doll to bed & said \"if you get up, I'm going to whup you\". (she's so tired this morning she just fell asleep on my lap as I typed this) OK, so here's my potty question. She would \"never\" wipe unless I absolutely made her. The first time I took her to the potty & got out tp for her to wipe with, she almost seemed afraid of it. She will often lie about whether she has wiped or not & I have been gently confronting her about that & letting her know that she \"must\" wipe to keep clean. From her dr. report that I received it seems she's had several UTI's which I'm guessing have been from her wrong (non-existent) wiping skills. My main quandry is this - I don't want to give her a bath more than 2-3 times a week right now because 1. it's winter & very cold - she is so cold after every bath, even though we crank up the heat, that her teeth are chattering & 2. her skin was so dry & ashy (she's AA) when she came to us & it's really looking better & doesn't itch her anymore, so I hate to dry it out with frequent baths. I don't feel like we've quite built the trust needed for me to really wipe her down well every night, but that's almost what I need to do. Should I just wait until we've built up some more trust before I begin doing something so private as to be wiping her down? She seems very guarded about her \"privates\", as she says. Or should I maybe mention it to the ped (we go a week from Mon.) & have her reinforce good wiping skills & maybe have the dr. tell M that Mommy will have to wipe her down each night? I know these probably sound like stupid questions. I know this stuff stems from her recent transition to us & also the environment she just came from, but I'm just wondering what steps I could/should take to help her move on. Thanks so much!

      "Thanks for the advice! She slept a little longer this morning, but then again, she was so tired from getting up at 7:30 am yesterday morning, that she fell asleep while I did her hair last night at about 6 & then proceeded to be awake for 2 hours between 10 & midnight. As for us, the early bedtimes won't work out. We are a ministry family with lots of evening meetings & activities that would require the kids to be up later, & also I have 3 teenage boys whose rooms are right next to hers & there's no way they would be quiet starting at 7 in the evening LOL I also homeschool, so there's no problem with her sleeping in till 9 or 9:30 in the morning...if she does it. Right now I have her laying down for quiet time watching Dora, but anytime she feels herself falling asleep, she gets up to potty or jerks herself awake somehow. I really think it's a transition issue that she just won't allow herself to sleep when others are awake right now. I just want to be careful not to start any bad habits with her while we work through this part. The flushable wipes are a great idea. I didn't even think of those. I am also going to talk to the ped to find out if there's a physical reason for her going to the potty 10-15 times a day, too. Thanks again! :-) Beth Mama to 6 BS S- 19 BS J- 17 BS J- 14 BS E- 9 AD E- 2 (Guatemala) Soon to be AD M- 3  \n",
      "Hi, I'm Beth. I joined this forum a couple of weeks ago & am learning a lot. We have just begun pre-placement visits with our new daughter who is 3. We met her last Monday & had her for 2 hours yesterday. We get her for 3 hours Tues. & 8 hrs. Fri... etc. Placement date is Feb. 29. We have never done a foster adoption & so I wasn't sure what to expect about it. This is what has happened so far & I'm just wondering if any of you who have been there/done that can help us to figure out what to do (or not do). The FM really wanted to adopt (not sure all the reasons she was denied, but she's elderly so I'm guessing her age was a main one). She is *very* unhappy at this situation (& understandably so). She is being very closed off & at times openly hostile, but mostly just very passive-agressive. We were told that there would be a meeting with the FM & our daughter before we met them so the SW could explain the situation, who we are, and show them our photo album (which I made specifically for this). The FM came in to talk to the SW a couple of days before that meeting, very distraught, and they cancelled it & decided to tell our daughter that we are \"just friends\" & not show her our photos. Our adoption worker was very vague about if/when/and, most importantly, who would be telling her what is really going on. She said we would transition it naturally. The problem is that they have refused to give our daughter the photo album to look through at home (she has seen it) & I'm pretty sure the FM is not talking about us to her during the week. When we went to pick her up on Sat. for our visit (just us & our 2 y.o. daughter; no SW present & FM did not communicate with us except to say bye), our new daughter seemed very confused & unsure of who we were. However, when I asked if she remembered meeting us at McDonald's, she shook her head yes. There is more to it, but this is the basic plot. We are just so concerned that basing our relationship on a \"lie\" is going to really backfire when someone finally tells her the truth. Our HS caseworker said this situation is never handled this way & she was not happy, but she is out of state on business for at least the next week, so we are on our own. I think our daughter's SW wants to let her know what's going on, but the adoption worker is the one dragging her feet. Sorry this got so long. Here are my questions - * Has anyone had an experience like this before - with being presented as \"just friends\" during the pre-placement visits? If so, how was that transitioned & who was the one talking to the child? * I just have a feeling with how things are going so far, that we will somehow be the ones to tell her. I so wish the FM would do it & really present this as positive, but I don't think that's going to happen. Were any of you the ones who told your child that you were not \"just friends\", you are the new parents? (this is not a child we've been fostering; we just met her 6 days ago) * Has anyone dealt with a very negative FM in this situation? How did you handle it? And were you able at some point to have a relationship with her or not? (we had planned to include her in our new daughter's life, but she is, at this point, not even basically courteous to us) Thanks so much for all your help! This is just such a new situation for us & we are being told that this is not a normal way to handle it & so we feel pretty lost. Blessings, Beth Mom to 4 bio boys S 18 J 17 J 14 E 9 Fostered a princess for almost 3 months 1/06 - 3/06 (relative placement) A princess from Guatemala E DOB 12/27/05 Home Forever 6/1/06 Failed Ethiopian adoption 11/07 A princess from the US S 3 Matched 12/17/07 Expected Placement 2/29/08  \n",
      "Our daughter has been with the same FM for about 2.5 years. She was placed with an aunt for a month last summer, so I thought she would be a little more accepting of the move now. Maybe she thought that since the relatives were done, it would finally be her chance. And, yes, definitely we've been praying for her & our new daughter. I would hate to think how bad things would be if we weren't. Beth  \n",
      "Yes, she is legally free for adoption. CSB got tpr in March 07 & then they started the placement try with the aunt. She will be able to be adopted by us 6 mo. after she comes to live here permanently. Visits seem to be going good. She is a little slow to warm up, but she is very welcoming to us touching her & she interacts with us well. Of course, at this point we are not a threat to her life with the FM because she thinks we are only friends. That may all change when she realizes who we truly are. They have told the FM that the visit schedule may have to be changed depending on how well things go. I know that means they will speed things up if she is not helping or if our daughter is not dealing with it very well. But I think the FM is under the impression that if she is difficult & fights this enough, they will delay placement. Since our daughter is only 3, how could I tell if the FM is undermining the placement & transition? Thanks for responding! It helps to know that there are others who understand, even if they haven't been through exactly the same thing. Beth  \n",
      "Well, I just got off the phone with the SW. After our visit, the FM said our daughter asked her if she was still her mama. I'm not sure how she answered. My heart is just breaking. She is very verbal, actually, and they know she is starting to realize something is going on, but no one is telling her what. They really think that after she starts visiting our home, she will gradually figure out for herself that we are her new family. It looks like we may be the ones to tell her the truth. I am praying for wisdom with that. We, as new people who have not yet earned her trust, should be the last ones to tell her what's going on. But I think she will begin asking questions this week. She comes for 3 hours tomorrow night & then 8-9 hours on Friday. We were absolutely open to continuing contact with the FM (as long as it wasn't too upsetting for our daughter), but unless she really changes her attitude, we will not be able to do it. I have promised the SW that we will send the FM pics & letters, even if we don't end up having visits. I did tell the SW that our daughter was very open toward us & she held my hand & allowed us to hug her and things like that, but that once she realizes we're her new mom & dad, she may not feel that way. She told me that she would be happy & that it would be a very smooth transition. I have lots of experience with children (not just my own) & I am not naive enough to think that she is going to be grateful & excited to have the only mom she has ever really known taken out of her life & be replaced by us. I guess I'm just afraid that this will hurt our attachment process during & after the transition. But at least for this week, I have no choice since the one person who is on our side is out of state. It has helped me so much to hear from all of you. It makes me feel like I'm not alone in this. Beth  \n",
      "We were in that situation in January & are now disrupting because of the significant undiagnosed SN this little girl has. Some questions I would ask (& pay much better attention to the answers than I did then): What are the diagnosed SN? Was there any drug/alcohol exposure prenatally (if so, how much - and don't trust the fact that the bmom says she quit, it may be true, but may not be true)? Did he/she reach developmental milestones on time? If not, was there any Early Intervention? Is the child in any type of therapy right now? What is the foster home like where the child is right now (# of other children, birth order of this child, single foster parent or couple, etc.)? If the child has been moved multiple times, what was the reason each time? If the child is in school, I would definitely ask all about performance, any IEPs, maybe talk to the teacher.... I wish I had paid closer attention to the red flags I saw then, but I was so excited and trusted the fact that the SW was telling me she was completely healthy & developmentally on target. Good luck! :-)  \n",
      "Well, I \"have\" 6 kids :-) and I can tell you from experience that there is no way we would have been able to go from 0 to 6 in one day & still preserve our sanity & our marriage...and 4 of ours are bio without the \"issues\" that foster kids come with. One of our boys has fairly significant special needs (behavioral/learning things) & he can be a handful himself. We would never be able to handle him at all if he was just placed in our home one day & we had not grown with him from birth. Our newest daughter that we are adopting from foster care has been diagnosed with asthma, a possible neurological problem (waiting on our specialist appt. in a couple weeks to find out), & is now starting therapy tomorrow for possible abuse at her foster home, all in the 2 months since she's arrived here. We were told that she was perfectly healthy with no developmental, physical, or psychological problems. That is not true at all - the former FM just never noticed or cared enough (whatever) to get her checked out. I have spent hours on the phone, more hours researching on the internet, & made numerous trips to the dr. (3x in 1 week) just for her, and that doesn't even include regular household chores & trying to keep my other 5 kids going. It has been very overwhelming. I know it is very exciting & all of us think we can do it before it actually happens, but the reality of taking in 6 foster children will be very much different than what you think it will be & very much different than birthing or adopting them one at a time. And having a big heart & a desire to help these children may not be enough to get you through. I would venture to say that several of them (if not all) have special needs that you will have to attend to, plus getting them all acclimated to your lifestyle (new rules, new expectations....even things as basic as table manners or bedtimes can be a major struggle) And be prepared that Children's Services may not be completely honest about all the issues the kids have....after our experience this time, I would definitely \"assume\" & plan for the fact that any child coming from foster care will have more severe needs than what they present. I don't think any of us want to make you feel bad or like we think you're not capable...I think that coming from voices of experience, we would just hate to see you or your dh hurt, or worse, your marriage destroyed by taking on too much too soon. Please let us know how things work out. :-) \n",

      "Tracey, I was told to go to Kinko's, too. My printing alone was over $300. and the binding was going to be at least that much. So, I bought some card stock and spirals and a friend of mine bound them for me at her office in less than 15 min. Check with friends to see if they might have a binding machine in their offices. I was very pleased with the outcome, the card stock I used was better looking than anything Kinko's had to offer. Theresa  \n",
      "Max, our dd was going only once a week (7 days). It was terrible, poor thing. Anyway, we changed her formula to the Enfamil Lipil low iron and she is much more comfortable now, though she still only goes about every 3-4 days! Hmmm, I wonder, does this mean we will have an anal-retentive child? Theresa  \n",
      "Wow! What beautiful letters. I agree, these are your words pouring straight from your heart onto the paper. Aside from a few little typos and a few needed word changes, the letters are wonderful. As an amom, I, too, would love our dd to recieve a letter like this someday. I am sure your daughter already knows what a wonderful mom you are. Best of luck to you.  \n",
      "Martha, I am so happy to see the new pictures of Addy. She is so gorgeous, I know you are proud. After all the jittery nerves isn't it great we have our little ones home with us now? It seems so long ago we were pm'ing each other and wondering what we could do to fill the time until our girls were home. Now, I can't even remember what it was like before Mary Scott was a part of our lives. I know you feel the same. Please post more when you can. Theresa  \n",
      "As a new adoptive parent I was wondering what your thoughts are regarding personalities and character. Do you think they are learned from the childs environment or do you think they are genetic? I find myself wondering what our three month old dd will be like as she grows older especially now that she is 'talking' and smiling and trying so hard to communicate. Both dh and I are wide-open, outgoing people. I've been fortunate enough to get to know dd's bmom very well and she is quite introverted and rarely smiles. This goes beyond finding herself pg and making an adoption plan, but that's her story to tell. Will dd be more inclined to be like us or her birthparents? So, back to the question at hand...what has been your experience? I look forward to hearing from you, Theresa  \n",
      "Thanks for the replys. I really found Elizabeth's info very interesting, even though I had to read it three times to understand it, lol.  \n",
      "OK, this will probably be silly to most of you, but I need to know I'm not the only one feeling this way. Are any of you new mom's having trouble letting go of the baby's out grown clothing? Mary Scott is only 3 months, but of course she is growing like a weed and outgrowing some of her clothing. I know I need to pass them on to someone that can use them, but it PAINS me to let them go. :( Are any of you feeling this way, too? How did you get over it? Did you keep certain items that were special like a going home outfit or Christmas outfit, etc. How are you storing them? I'm such a sentamental fool!!!! Theresa  \n",
      "Sylvester, you nailed it!!! That is exactly it, I feel sad because she is growong so fast and she won't ever be that small again. I have cried so much since she has been with us, far more than I ever did before she came home to us. I guess I never expected this feeling I have for her to be this intense. I love her so much it makes my heart hurt--crazy, I know. Both my sis and sil are done having children so I won't be able to see my nieces wearing the clothing, but I'm sure I can find someone that needs them. My plan all along was to keep some of the more special outfits and let the others go. I'll just have to grit my teeth and do it. Thanks for your input, guys. I feel better knowing I'm not alone. Theresa  \n",
      "Mary Scott LOVES being on her tummy. During the day while she is napping I let her sleep on her tummy (because I can check her constantly) she is far more comfortable this way. I talked to our cw about this and she said this practice was fine so long as i did keep checking her. MS had very good head/neck control and was rolling to her side before she ever left the hospital. She is a very strong 3 month old. In this picture I think she is about 6 wks old.  \n",

When my 8wk old is fussy (very rare) and I can't seem to get anything done--it doesn't matter. She is the most important thing in our lives and it is a privlage to be her mommy.

Have fun with the shopping. Theresa  \n",

      "Hey folks. I posted on the ICPC thread, but thought I'd post here as well to get more attention. Here's our deal.... We are in Tulsa waiting to take our new baby back to Georgia. K goes to court today for TPR and after that begins the ICPC waiting game. My question is this, have any of you ever taken an adopted baby back to GA. How long did it take to get the paperwork back from Atlanta? Will GA call with an approval so that we can get on the road and make our way home? What happens if you leave the birth state but you do not enter the receiving state--you just wait it out on the state line? Can this be done? Thanks, Theresa  \n",
      "Help!!!! We want to go home..... We are dealing with Oklahoma as the birth state and Georgia as the receiving state. Have any of you dealt with GA as a receiving state and will they notify you by a phone call with permission to travel home. Also, can you leave the birth state and get to the stated line of the receiving state? K goes before the court today for TPR and so now we are looking at an additional 5-6 days here (been here since Friday) for all of the overnights of ICPC.  \n",

      "Yep! Even well meaning family members would say things like, 'Oh, you don't want to go out of the country to adopt?' or, 'have you considered foreign adoption?'  I finally had to get p-o'ed enough to say, 'you know what, I've researched adoption for well over a year. Tell me, how long have you researched foreign adoption and why do you find it preferrable over domestic?' That usually shut them up. Bottom line, you and your wife made your decision because it works best for you. You will soon have a little one home so don't let the doubting Thomas' rain on your parade. Good luck to you.  \n",

      "Hi, I'm wondering if airlines give discounts for domestic adoption. Have any of you ever received any such deals? Thanks, Theresa  \n",
      "Thanks for the info. I looked at the sites and it is for international--not domestic. Oh, well. I also talked to Federal Travel a couple months ago and their prices were right in line with expedia or cheap tickets. I will say that the people there at Federal were wonderful to talk to so if you want to let an agent book your travel, go with them. Hope its ok to write that!!!  \n",
      "Don't be scared, it's really no big deal. They just run your fingerprints to see if you have a criminal record. You have to declare any arrests you had and give a written explanation. My dh had a DUI back in 1986 (soph year of college) and he had to write and explanation and also he had to write about the lesson he learned from the experience. Also, do not leave anything out. If you do have something from way back when and you don't declare it that would be far worse than just letting it come to light through the background check. As far as court records, I don't know, but I doubt it.  You will have to give a copy of your marriage license to your cw for your file, at least we did. DOn't worry about it. This is small patatos compared to all the other hoops you'll have to jump through for the homestudy. I'd much rather deal with this part than have all the medical done again (I don't like needles). Seriously, a few months ago when we started our homestudy, I came to this forum and asked the same kinds of questions because I was freaked out about it. It isn't the big scary thing I thought it was, just lots of paper work!!! Relax, you'll do just fine. Theresa  \n",
      "No they won't send the men in black suits. I agree, it is a bit scary when starting out, but after your first meeting with the cw you'll be so pumped up and ready to get the whole thing done you'll be willing to endure anything they throw at you. Best of luck to you. T  \n",

      "MrsV, I'm sending you a pm! Theresa  \n",
      "Kat, We are involved in (and requested) a semi-open adoption. We have met the expectant mom and her family. They know our first names and the state we live in and K has access to us by an 800 number that she can phone anytime, day or night. K is a minor and at this time feels that she wants very little contact after the birth. WE will keep tabs on her and will work it out should she one day want to meet her child. We are set to send pictures and letters to her. We were matched only 13 weeks after our initial meeting regarding our adoption plan As to your question regarding birthmom expenses, we are going through an agency and our fees and expense money are in escrow to be paid out as needed. Since K lives at home, she needs no living expenses (rent, utilities, etc..) What we have paid out for her is her medical insurance deductible, $150 per month for additional groceries, $50 per month for incidentals, and $350 for maternity clothing. All the rest we've paid have been agency fees, attorney fees and such. When you are with your agency or facilitator they will match you with a situation that fits your profile as well as the birth parents. Good luck and keep us posted on your progress. Theresa  \n",
      "No, you don't sound pathetic. When we first started, I, too, was asking questions at every opportunity. Even freaking out over things that turned out to be no big deal. Yes, a 40-something couple can adopt. Relax, don't worry. Just sit down with your agency and tell them what you want and need and they will find the match that best suits you and the birth parents. Are you planning on using an agency, facilitator or networking on your own? I researched for awhile and decided that an agency gave us the protection we felt we needed against scams and the loss of money should the parents opt not to go through with the adoption.  \n",
      "We also used an adoption advocate here in Georgia. She works with folks all over the country. She was great in helping us narrow down the agencies that would work best for us and it allowed us to work with several agencies at a time. In fact, the agency that we are now contracted with was on the list she gave me, but I had not applied with them, as we were just begining the whole process. We are very happy with the way things have worked out for us. I'm sure you'll find a quick match as well. T  \n",

      "Even though we are setting up the nursey we've told our families and friends that we want to wait for the showers until after the baby is home with us. Right now we are matched with a baby girl due in Oct, but if that were to fall through and we were later matched with a boy then we would have lots of exchanging to do. Of course the grandmas are excitedly buying pink frilly things now anyway. They can't seem to help it!!!!!! Theresa  \n",
      "Ok, so I have this book, \"The Girlfriends Guide To What A Baby Needs\". Great book with lots of good info, I recommend it for us first time parents. Ok, in the book they talk about car seats and the importance of finding the seat that fits your car/truck/suv the best. Not just sticking in some seat you buy at a garage sale, it really needs to fit. My thought is to have those of you already using car seats to tell us newbies which seat you have and the model car you have. Also any info you can share regarding your likes and dislikes. What do you think? Theresa  \n",
      "Keep it coming. I love the first hand feed back, it really does help me (and others, too, I hope).  \n",

      "Brandy, I can't answer your question, but I did want to tell you that I can't think of a soul here on these boards that would look down on you for your medical condition.

The one that really got to me was the point about helping our child choose a college. You ruined it for me-AUBURN??? LOL!!! I think you meant to say UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA, didn't you? (Bama grads) ROLL TIDE, ROLL. Seriously, great post. We, too, are waiting on our little girl. She is due sometime between Oct 12- 27 (due date keeps changing). My DH wants her to make her debut on Nov 20 at the Bama vs. Auburn game. He's already got her infant Bama cheerleader outfit! Theresa (I just realized my avitar. It's Tigger, not a tiger, lol!)  \n",

      "I saw the sunset funeral last night. Michael's speach was beautiful and quite touching. In his speach he said that his father never once, either in front of him or behind his back, called him his \"adopted son\". He just called him HIS SON and Michael just called him dad. Mr. Reagan, a perfect example of a father loving and accepting a child brought into his family through adoption as HIS OWN. I have only one thing to say regarding the media, \"Sc*** them\" for making this an issue. As far as Michael not being on the first row with Nancy, Ron, Ron's wife and Patty, Michael was with his wife, Colleen (sp) and his children Ashly and Cameron. I cannot imagine anyone disallowing him the opportunity to sit with President Reagan's other children, Michael's brother's and sisters. But, who knows? All in all, a touching send off for a great American. I know we, in our family, will always miss him.  \n",
      "Our story... Feb 3, I had a meeting inquiring about adoption Feb 23, Turned in a rough draft of our family profile, made a couple of small changes Month of March, began home study paper work, continued to work on profile April 17, received call about a situation. Asked if our profile could be shown, \"Well, heck yeah!!!! Show it!!\" May 3, recieved the call that we were matched Although we've had a little kink in the plan, Dh and I are still very excited and sticking with our original plan. We are already in love with this little girl and we can't wait until October.  \n",
      "\"A watched pot never boils\" That's the attitude that I had while waiting for the call. If you keep thinking, everytime the phone rings, \"this is it!\", you will experience disappointment when you pick up the phone and its Sears Home Improvement wanting to sell you vinyle siding! Enjoy the summer and have fun. All of our dreams will be realized in God's time. Theresa  \n",
      "What a great husband you have. Maybe we can set up a training school, to be headed by your DH, that will train men in the area of romance!!!! Congrats on your pregnancy.  \n",
      "Ok, we're matched and everything was going great until today when K tells us that there is a possibility of another father after her due date was pushed back from Oct 10 to Oct 27. Dh is freaking out, I think it is the child of the original father. ANy clues on how to figure this out would be quite helpful. Thanks, Theresa  \n",
      "she told me that dad #1 was THE dad and she slept with him on Jan 26 and again on Feb 3. Since the date has been moved from Oct 10 to Oct 27 she then decided she needed to tell us about dad #2. K told me she slept with dad #2 in early Jan. Well, I took mj's suggestion and googled the info I needed. By playing around with the dates of last period (since I don't know her cycle) I got the date of conception as Feb 4 which gives the due date of Oct 27! Am I trying to hard to make this work the way I want it to? Does this make since by calculating backwards from due date to figure conception?  \n",
      "So what you all are telling me is that the due date can fluctuate by several weeks!! YIKES!!!! I spoke with the cw today and she said the doctor told her that the first ultra sound is usually the most accurate, which would be Oct 10 and the first guy would be the dad. We'll just have to wait and see what happens with her next couple of dr. appointments.  \n",
      "How wonderful for you all. Keep us posted.  \n",
      "You will love the support and advice you'll get from all your new friends here. Be prepared, though, you'll become addicted to the site as so many of us are..... Theresa  \n",
      "While reading your post tears came to my eyes. I am so very happy for you and your little \"heir\".  \n",
      "We were also matched recently so I know what you mean. The whole first week after finding out I couldn't relax. I just kept thinking about the business end of the deal. Now though I'm happy but reserved. I know she has a right to change her mind or to parent and I respect that.  \n",
      "I do understand where you are coming from as well. My husband and I are so excited about this match that we're barely able to sleep at night. We talk about our future with this baby and all we hope for. Even though I am guarded, I am buying baby furniture, picking out bedding, choosing baby names & dreaming of this Christmas. I've read to many posts on here to know that the chance of that happening is more than the 15% the adoption professionals claim. In spite of all the joyful emotions we are experiencing, I try to stay cognizant of reality. The reality being, K could change her mind. You are right, though. If I were filled with fear and reservation rather than love for this baby, I'm sure that K would have her reservations about me as well. So to clarify my earlier statement, we are recently matched with an expectant due date of Oct. 12. We are so very happy and planning for our future as parents. DH and I talk constanatly about our new lives. Through all of the joy, though, I do know that it doesn't always work out as we hope. Thank you for your post as it made me reread mine and see how it did not convey my true meaning!!! Theresa  \n",

      "what color is the furniture?  \n",
      "This is what I would like to ask K to make for the baby. I will be meeting her this weekend for the first time so I will have to feel her out. I think it would be a wonderful treasure for the child later in life. Theresa  \n",
      "Ok, Ladies. I've seen the term life book many times throughout the posts, but I'm not exactly sure what it is. I would appreciate your comments and examples! Thanks, Theresa  \n",
      "Ok, I have that book, Our Chosen Child. So, a life book is essentially a baby book, right? I am meeting K this weekend and I really want to ask ker to make a scrapbook or something for the baby. It may sound goofy, but I just imagine reading her book as a bedtime story to the baby in the future.  \n",
      "Dee, I've got something to share with you regarding the profile. If you would like to chat, pm me. Theresa  \n",
      "Ok, we are now matched and everything is moving along. DH and I are flying out to meet K in another week and I'm so excited and also a little nervous. She is a teen expectant mom, 16, how do I talk to her? The cw says K is shy and also that she is a \"young 16\". Any advice will be appreciated. Theresa  \n",
      "Thank you for the advice. The sw will be there with us so that will help. The sw did say that K's whole family wants to meet us (parents, grandparents and boyfriend-not the father) I am very interested in K and want to know all about her. We both want a semiopen adoption so I want to have as much information about K as possible. The baby is due in October and yes, this will be our first child. (I've been going to other websites to find pictures of a fetus week by week) I can't wait.  \n",
      "All prayers are eagerly accepted!!!! Yes, we are going to send pictures and letters. K, more so than me, wants very little contact after the birth. That's why I want to have as much info about her as I can gleen in the few meetings we will have. Tb  \n",
      "David, \"In my case, it always bothers me that the aparents always say, \"thank you for this wonderful gift!\". We didnt give them a gift, we gave our child a gift. Comments like these simply deny what we did.\" Yes, you indeed gave your child a gift, but you also blessed a family by entrusting your child to them. As a hopeful adoptive mom I can't imagine not thanking the birth family. I don't think a show of gratitude is meant as a denial for the \"heroic\" actions of a birth family. (As their actions are truly the heroic) I'll never know the depth of grief that you or other's like you endure. But for someone like me whose dream of a family will be realized by adoption I am so very greatful for the GIFT of adoption. Theresa  \n",
      "((((((amomfor2)))))) Other's here before me have said it far better than I ever could. But just know that you have many people sending thoughts and prayers your way. Theresa  \n",
      "Riley, We are waiting for a semi-open adoption. As it was explained to me, a SOA is when letters and photos are exchanged through a third party like an attorney or through the agency. This is my comfort level. It takes someone very different than me to open up all of all of themselves to the birthfamilies. I've seen here on this site that OA works for many people. It's just not for us. I have no problem sharing info with my child regarding the birthfamily. In fact I would gladly help my child reunite with the birthfamily when the time is right. I know that there are expectant moms out there that have no desire for contact or only want an occasional letter or photo. In fact we are being shown to our first bmom now and she only wants a photo every once in a while. (we just started all this in Feb). Anyway, hope this answered your question. Theresa  \n",
      "We have been getting some really good news here the last few days!! Awaiting, I'm so happy for you! Congrats!! Theresa  \n",
      "We were notified today that we are matched with an e-bmom in OK. I was wondering if any of you have adopted from that state and were you able to finalize there? Thanks, theresa  \n",
      "Is this episode, on open-adoption, airing on Friday also about the Fast Track Adoption book? Or is that a whole other animal? Just curious as to when and if that episode will now be shown in light of what happened. Theresa  \n",
      "our attorney uses MI as an example everytime we talk about ICPC so there must be something to what you are hearing. From what he has said the paperwork was sent back to Georgia three times before it was finally approved in Michigan. Also that the judge required a lot of \"redundant\" info., more so than other states. I know it's not a lot of info to offer you. But, like I said, everytime we talk about ICPC he brings up MI. Good luck to you. I hope you are blessed soon. Theresa  \n",
      "are there any adoptees out there that are happy with their adoptive parents? Rereading some of these posts from the last few days has me worried that adoptees are going to grow up with nothing but disdain for their adoptive parents. If you are out there, what did your adoptive parents do differently? How/when were you told of your adoption? Were you part of open/semi/or closed adoptions? No disrespect intended here, but as a hopeful adoptive parent, I haven't been seeing anything but negitivity towards adoptive families.  \n",
      "Well, I honestly thought it wasn't something for \"me\". Now, after much reading, I see it is not about my husband and me, but rather about the well being of our child. Again, until reading the \"rants\" (no disrespect intended), I never pondered all of the emotional turmoil you and others like you have endured because of secrets. I will look into and seriously consider open vs semi.  \n",
      "I wanted to say thank you to all who chimed in on this thread and also for the links to the other, recommended threads. I had my one-on-one meeting yesterday with our case worker, for the homestudy, and I did discuss my concerns with her. She offered the same advise as DL. \"Whether to have an open, semi-open or closed adoption is a very personal decision. I would look into your own hearts to decide what you are most comfortable with. Forcing yourself to have an open adoption, if it's not really what you are comfortable with, is not, IMO, in the best interest of the child. Neither is pushing a bMom that does not want contact into an open adoption in the best interest of the child. There are many bMoms that do desire a closed adoption.essentially\" So, in a nutshell, this website has given me far more information regarding adoption than any other source.  \n",
      "I just went back and read some of the posts regarding the births of the babies due last week and I can't help but wonder if we're being ultra sensative. I don't think any of those posters meant any disrespect by announcing what was going on in relation to the labor process. I saw it as excitement and joy not as cold, hard women waiting for the brood mare to drop. As far as the \"we\" and \"us\" goes, again, I don't think it is out of context here. They are obviously a part of a wonderful triad. The birth/expectant/biological (?) parents have included them in every aspect of the pregnancy and delivery. They were in \"us\" and \"we\" situations. And I certainly don't feel that is was meant to take anything away from the birthparents.  There is a difference between the women posting earlier this week and the woman that wrote the book Fast Track Adoption.  \n",
      "The book I metioned earlier is the Complete Adoption Guide; Everything You Need To Know To Adopt A Child.  \n",
      "WE haven't even started our homestudy yet (starts tomorrow) and I went looking at baby furniture today. I got so choked up I had to leave the store. Then I went to the book store to find books on adoption. Well, I walked through the kids section and they had these Easter Bunnies all over the place. I started thinking about the day DH and I will experience Easter, Christmas and even the tooth fairy with our child---got teary-eyed again. So, to answere your question NO, you're not alone. Every child I see reminds me of what's to come and my heart, too, wants to explode. I'M READY, TOO!!!  \n",
      "DH and I decided to adopt a while ago. We're happy and excited about our decision, right.  Well, I tell my dad. His response, \" why do you want to do a thing like that? You've got a great life, can come and go as you please. Why do you want dirty diapers and someone screaming in your ear?\" He says he's kidding, but.... My excuse for him is that my parents were very young when they had me and his life changed tremendously. He likes children fine when they are self reliant!!! I tell my grandmother, to whom I am very close. \"Will they match the baby's looks to yours?\" WHAT????????????? \"You're not going to tell the baby they are adopted are you?\" HUH????????????? My excuse for her is she is from the old school when everything was hush, hush about adoption.  \n",
      "I just found this site a day or two ago and I have to say I'm so glad. I look forward to reading the posts and replys. I feel as though I'm learning so much. So many of you sound as if you've been around the adoption block a time or two. The advice and recomedations you offer are of great comfort to me and others, too, I'm sure. The only problem I see is that I can't leave my computer, the laundry is piling up and I can't stop eating the jellybeans! By reading the posts and replys I've been given far more to think about. For instance, I didn't realize you needed a pediatrition lines up nor did I consider attachment disorders for little ones. The list goes on......  \n",
      "I understand. I feel like everytime I talk to a family member about the open/semi-open adoptions that I'm talking in circles. And of course everyone had \"great\" advice for me. My parents and grandparents don't get that times have changed. They don't understand the ** expenses, being in the delivery room, or telling the child they are adopted for that matter. I've found that it's hard talking to others about adoption. They say they understand but, how can they, really? They haven't had to rely on someone else to make their dream of a family come true.  \n",
      "Congratulations!! No words of advise from me as we are just beginning our adoption journey. I do, however, wish you all the best. As far as travel goes, I know I saw somewhere that there is a travel agency that specializes in booking for adoptive families at discounts. I will look through all of our collected info and if I find it I will send you a PM. Hopefully someone reading this may have some info on this as well. Theresa  \n",
      "We will begin our home study very soon and I think I'm the most \"freaked\" about that! Please, someone, relieve my fears. We are planning a domestic adoption, if that matters at all as to what the HS requires.  \n",
      "WHAT DOES THAT POST FROM \"ONE WHO KNOWS\" HAVE TO DO WITH ADOPTION?? THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ANY SUNDAY SCHOOL LESSON I'VE EVER HAD! LET'S TALK ABOUT BRINGING BABIES HOME!!!!!!  \n",
      "We were asked to follow a specific guide line as it has been proven succesful in the past. Our profile ended up being 14 pages. Sounds like a lot but there are lots of photos of us in various activities such as ball games, travel, with family and especially with children. I also had my 2 older nieces and nephew write letters about us (this was precious- out of the mouths of babes, they say) We had to describe our home, our personalities, our families and so on. No scrapbook style here, though. We had ours professionally put together after we did all the writing and pulling of the pictures. I'm not good at scrap booking so this worked well for me. I also found that I wasn't in a great deal of picks as I am always behind the camera. What I did was set the timer on the camera and tried to act natural.......ya, right! Good luck and have fun.  \n",
      "I sent you a pm  \n",
      "My husband and I are just beginning our adoption journey and are beginning the home study. Why am I freaked out about this phase of the process? Can someone telll me what to expect? We're using AAA partners in Adoption for the home study only. \n",
