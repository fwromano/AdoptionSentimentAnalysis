It is a very personal part of who I am and so very dear to my heart to hear that you want to raise a child to be kind, compassionate and independent. I am glad that you want to teach them that life is not always easy or fair and that there will be obstacles to overcome along the way, but the fight will make them stronger in the end. Unconditional love is the absolute, most important thing that I ask my child be given by the family I choose to entrust with their life, happiness and future, if that is the path that is ultimately chosen. I feel comfort in that you would be willing to communicate updates, milestones and send pictures.

      "Lots of things, actually! I really appreciate your honestly and the openness about her biological family that you have shared with Quinn. I like that your family is comfortable with adoption, and it's regarded as something very positive. I like that your family shares a lot of the same interests as I do! Hiking has always been something I did with my family, as well as kayaking! There is nothing better than a Minnesota summer! I like all the time and freedom your schedules allow, so that you are so actively involved in your current child and your future children's lives. I also like that Eileen and I share same the educational background in speech pathology;  just an added perk I guess! I like that Christmas is so important in your lives, it may seem silly but Christmas is always the happiest time of my lives and seems to be that way for you as well. I like that we have lots of similarities, from Avatar, mangoes and strawberries, Star Wars, to our faith, I think one of the most important things for a good fit for my child is that interests and traits he may get from me, will be valued and loved in your family as well. I guess the biggest piece that drew me to your profile was that I get the feeling you truly can give him the stable, loving, accepting, and fun home life that I had and that I always imagined for my children. I want him to be able to grow up knowing he's loved and feel positive about his family, and I believe the feelings and attitudes that you, Brad and Eileen, convey, seem to help him feel confident in who he is.\n",

You will let them find their authentic selves. I am also happy to hear not only that you‚Äôre open to being a transracial family, but you have a plan on how to embrace their culture if the baby is a bipoc. My child would be mixed race and it is essential to me that they would be raised in an environment where their blackness is embraced, celebrated and loved. That they‚Äôd have mentors or a community of black individuals that could be there for them. I liked seeing that you would continue to educate yourselves too and always be learning more on black issues. The last thing I noticed that was important to me was your willingness to have an open adoption. This decision for me has been hardest thing I‚Äôve ever faced, but ultimately it feels right to give my baby the life they deserve and to make another family‚Äôs dream come true. I would love to stay in contact, receive pictures, even chat about how they‚Äôre doing and maybe in the future we could set up visits.

It is a very personal part of who I am and so very dear to my heart to hear that you want to raise a child to be kind, compassionate and independent. I am glad that you want to teach them that life is not always easy or fair and that there will be obstacles to overcome along the way, but the fight will make them stronger in the end. Unconditional love is the absolute, most important thing that I ask my child be given by the family I choose to entrust with their life, happiness and future, if that is the path that is ultimately chosen. I feel comfort in that you would be willing to communicate updates, milestones and send pictures. I truly believe that you both do respect the selflessness it takes for a birth mother to choose adoption and I think it is admirable that to show that respect, you have fully committed to fulfilling your roles as supportive, nurturing parents to the child who is meant for you.\n",

Hiking has always been something I did with my family, as well as kayaking! There is nothing better than a Minnesota summer!

I like that we have lots of similarities, from Avatar, mangoes and strawberries, Star Wars, to our faith, I think one of the most important things for a good fit for my child is that interests and traits he may get from me, will be valued and loved in your family as well. I guess the biggest piece that drew me to your profile was that I get the feeling you truly can give him the stable, loving, accepting, and fun home life that I had and that I always imagined for my children.

I also loved that you guys said that even though you were adopted by one family, you guys still kept in contact with your birth parents and thats something i REALLY was hoping for.

Trying new things, getting to explore new places all while surrounded by a family who loves you is all i asked for and making sure my son has that is very important to me. I also love that you guys are open to me still being in the childs life, I fear that my son may be angry with me if i was to just leave him and never come back so occasionally, when the time is right, i would like to just pop in to show i still care no matter the distance !\n",

Family cultures are extremely important to me. As well as sports. I was the best of the best in gymnastics, track, and many others. Athleticisim is in Sam's genes from my entire family and I'd like for him to have the opportunity to excel at that talent if he would like. I just felt completely at ease with the two of you. I've search many many profiles. Everything I felt just came back to Stephen and Erica. My dad's name is Steven and Sam is named after him too. Things just seem to fit. My gut says you are the people that deserve my son and vice versa.\n",

You will let them find their authentic selves. I am also happy to hear not only that you‚Äôre open to being a transracial family, but you have a plan on how to embrace their culture if the baby is a bipoc. My child would be mixed race and it is essential to me that they would be raised in an environment where their blackness is embraced, celebrated and loved. That they‚Äôd have mentors or a community of black individuals that could be there for them. I liked seeing that you would continue to educate yourselves too and always be learning more on black issues. The last thing I noticed that was important to me was your willingness to have an open adoption. This decision for me has been hardest thing I‚Äôve ever faced, but ultimately it feels right to give my baby the life they deserve and to make another family‚Äôs dream come true. I would love to stay in contact, receive pictures, even chat about how they‚Äôre doing and maybe in the future we could set up visits.

It's nice to see that they're financially stable too, what with John being an engineer and Lisa working as a graphic designer. They don't have any kids of their own yet, but they've got a really loving relationship with their nieces and nephews, and it looks like they're all about family. Plus, I noticed from their profile that they value education a lot and they plan to provide a strong educational background for the child. It's also pretty cool that they're open to any race – that's really important to me. They've got a beautiful home and seem like they live in a nice, safe neighborhood.
